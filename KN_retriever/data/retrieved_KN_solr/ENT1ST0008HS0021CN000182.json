Abdul Rahman, a Muslim convert to Christianity, narrowly escaped the death penalty for apostasy when the Afghan government -- acting under enormous international pressure -- sidestepped the issue by ruling that he was insane and unfit to stand trial. This unsatisfactory ruling left unanswered a question of enormous significance: Does Islam truly require the death penalty for apostasy, and, if not, why is there so little freedom of religion in the so-called Muslim world?\n\nThe Koran and the sayings of the prophet Muhammad do not definitively address this issue. In fact, during the early history of Islam, the Agreement of Hudaibiyah between Muhammad and his rivals stipulated that any Muslim who converted out of Islam would be allowed to depart freely to join the non-Muslim community. Nevertheless, throughout much of Islamic history, Muslim governments have embraced an interpretation of Islamic law that imposes the death penalty for apostasy.\n\nIt is vital that we differentiate between the Koran, from which much of the raw material for producing Islamic law is derived, and the law itself. While its revelatory inspiration is divine, Islamic law is man-made and thus subject to human interpretation and revision. For example, in the course of Islamic history, non-Muslims have been allowed to enter Mecca and Medina. Since the time of the caliphs, however, Islamic law has been interpreted to forbid non-Muslims from entering these holy cities. The prohibition against non-Muslims entering Mecca and Medina is thus politically motivated and has no basis in the Koran or Islamic law.\n\nIn the case of Rahman, two key principles of Islamic jurisprudence come into play. First, al-umuru bi maqashidiha (\"Every problem [should be addressed] in accordance with its purpose\"). If a legal ordinance truly protects citizens, then it is valid and may become law. From this perspective, Rahman did not violate any law, Islamic or otherwise. Indeed, he should be protected under Islamic law, rather than threatened with death or imprisonment. The second key principle is al-hukm-u yadullu ma'a illatihi wujudan wa adaman (\"The law is formulated in accordance with circumstances\"). Not only can Islamic law be changed -- it must be changed due to the ever-shifting circumstances of human life. Rather than take at face value assertions by extremists that their interpretation of Islamic law is eternal and unchanging, Muslims and Westerners must reject these false claims and join in the struggle to support a pluralistic and tolerant understanding of Islam.\n\nAll of humanity, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, is threatened by the forces of Islamist extremism. It is these extremists, masquerading as traditional Muslims, who angrily call for the death of Abdul Rahman or the beheading of Danish cartoonists. Their objective is raw political power and the eventual radicalization of all 1.3 billion Muslims worldwide. Western involvement in this \"struggle for the soul of Islam\" is a matter of self-preservation for the West and is critical given the violent tactics and strength of radical elements in Muslim societies worldwide.\n\nMuslim theologians must revise their understanding of Islamic law, and recognize that punishment for apostasy is merely the legacy of historical circumstances and political calculations stretching back to the early days of Islam. Such punishments run counter to the clear Koranic injunction \"Let there be no compulsion in religion\" (2:256).\n\nPeople of goodwill of every faith and nation must unite to ensure the triumph of religious freedom and of the \"right\" understanding of Islam, to avert global catastrophe and spare millions of others the fate of Sudan's great religious and political leader, Mahmoud Muhammad Taha, who was executed on a false charge of apostasy. The millions of victims of \"jihadist\" violence in Sudan -- whose numbers continue to rise every day -- would have been spared if Taha's vision of Islam had triumphed instead of that of the extremists.\n\nThe greatest challenge facing the contemporary Muslim world is to bring our limited, human understanding of Islamic law into harmony with its divine spirit -- in order to reflect God's mercy and compassion, and to bring the blessings of peace, justice and tolerance to a suffering world.\n\nThe writer is a former president of Indonesia.

Anti-semitism is linked to Islamophobia. If you are spreading the former, you will reap the latter. And while the recent Gallup Poll didn't report directly on this, my guess is if you are spreading the latter, you will reap the former.\n\nThat bias is hateful to God is an ancient religious teaching. Take the Qur'anic idea that all human beings have the breath of God, or the Judeo-Christian teaching that we are all made in God's image.\n\nEvery religion holds up the ideal of the equal dignity of human beings. And every generation finds a way to violate that ideal by directing hatred at other communities. But prejudice is like cancer - it spreads.\n\nIf we can't find a way to follow the ancient teachings of our religions, perhaps we will be more likely to heed the lessons of a more contemporary tool - the poll. The single highest predictor of prejudice against Muslims is prejudice against Jews.\n\nLet's make this as personal as possible. When someone in your synagogue says something ugly about Muslims, know that he is marshaling the forces of anti-Semitism. When someone in your mosque speaks hatefully about Jews, know that he is putting your Muslim children more at risk.\n\nFor the purposes of prejudice, the terms 'dirty Muslim' and 'dirty Jew' are virtually interchangeable.

However Pakistan is riven with sectarian hate, and many even consider the 15% of the population who are shia as kaafirs. The shia are blasted regularly around the country. Since Ismailis are part of the shia, in that sense they are also killed by the true believers among the Sunnis.

But I doubt it is for religous reasons. They come done even harder on islamists than on these apostates. Summary executions and life imprisonments is a norm for muslim brotherhood activists. Islam has already declared that there is no compulsion in religion!\n\nI can speak for Pakistan, we consider Ismailis and Ahmedis as apostates.

The Christians are free to build their Churches, carry out their religous practice freely, they have job quotas and reserved seats in the parliament which is in addition to what they can get on their own.\n\nYour hatefilled rant speaks volumes of your ignorance. Dhimmism used to be practiced during middle ages. During that time the Christian Crusaders used to kill all muslim prisoners in any territory they occupied and even ate those people (Ma'arrat al-Numan!).

The fact of the matter is that there is no Dhimmism around these days.\n\nThere was no rejection of the UDHR by muslim delegates. The current UDHR is based upon Judeo-Christian Principles. There is nothing wrong with muslim countries demanding that their sensibilities also be taken into account just as those of Jews and Christians. In a democratic system there is nothing wrong in demanding your rights. If the majority of UN feels that this demand is unjustified I believe the muslims would move on.

The \"Abrahamic faiths\" aren't quite the same, especially in their view of Abraham.\n\nWhile Christianity accepts the Torah as the Old Testament and just says a new word came through Jesus, Islam claims something else. They rewrote both books, saying Christianity and Judaism lied about Abraham, Moses, Jesus and much of the rest of the books.\n\nIslam has a very different interpretation and it can't be lumped in the same category as Judaism and Christianity.\n\nBoth Islam and Judaism (and, thus, Christianity) are considered \"Abrahamic faiths,\" in that they stem from a connection to Abraham as described in the Torah, the Bible, and the Qu'ran. Since Islam is predominantly an Arabic religion, it has been concluded that Islam stems from Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham and half-brother of Isaac father of Jacob (later named Israel).\n\nThe following verses from Quran proves the point ....\n\nAnd He(Allah) taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: \"Tell me the names of these if ye are right.\" ( Quran,Al-Baqara, Chapter #2, Verse #31)\n\nAllah did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of 'Imran above all people,- ( Quran,Aal-e-Imran, Chapter #3, Verse #33)\n\nWe(Allah) have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. ( Quran,An-Nisa, Chapter #4, Verse #163)\n\nAnd remember We(Allah) took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant: ( Quran,Al-Ahzab, Chapter #33, Verse #7)\n\nThe only \"ignorance\" here is Christians trying to disown Islam as a part of their intolerant common Abrahamic \"my-way-or-the highway\" denominator.\n\nPosted by: coloradodog | January 27, 2010 11:05 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nHirsi Ali says it well: ************* http://www.aei.org/article/100627 Nowhere in the world is bigotry so rampant as in Muslim countries. No difference is greater between American and Islamic principles than the founding ideals of both. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of Islam that al-Qa'ida and other Muslim puritans insist on the implementation of sharia law, jihad and the eternal subjection of women. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of America that blacks and women fought for--and gained--equal rights and gays and new immigrants continue to do so.\n\nI would include Thomas Jefferson's improvements on the New Testament. The king, the sheik and the ayatollah have the authority to rule that parts of the Koran no longer apply in the modern world. For instance, the edicts of sharia law that reject scientific inquiry and order all Muslims to spread Islam.\n\nAnd of course, no reading selection would be complete without a copy of the US Constitution, highlighting (because you can do that in a Kindle) the Eighth Amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAnd for good measure, I would also add John F.Kennedy's inaugural address: \"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. . . . To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required. . . . To those nations who would make themselves our adversary . . . we dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. . . . Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\" Not to mention woman.\n\nI wish he [Obama] would host a reading summit where we truly \"say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts that too often are said only behind closed doors\".

Muslims have proudly documented the long history of such Dhimmitude and they were the ones who first made Jews wear yellow symbols of identification on clothing, long before Germany did.\n\nIslam has three ordered choices it offers conquered infidels: Conversion, acceptance of Dhimmi status and death. Is it any real wonder why many of the indigenous people conquered by Jihad accepted conversion in order to escape the later two choices?\n\nThat also goes back to one of my original points.

Sadly, he shows that statistics is another area of ignorance.As the main body of people hating Jews today is the Muslim World, his initial presence falls flat on its face.\n\nSadly, though, Patel's main problem isn't ignorance, it's intentional propaganda, his usual tool. Go to the link he gives for the poll. Look at the chart on page 7. The responders seem to dislike Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism at around the same percentage. Yes, Christianity is in the mix. Muslims, on the other had, are disliked at a much higher rate.\n\nCould it be because Jihad declared a war on the West and Muslims have been killing and trying to kill us for decades? No, says Patel, it's because we also hate Jews. Sorry, doesn't follow.\n\nOn page eight, they switch from the religions to people who follow the religion. The pattern remains. There's a major statistical difference between dislike of Muslims and the other religious adherents.\n\nOn page 13, the study tries to link the prejudice against Jews with that against Muslims. Notice a religion disappears: Buddhism. Gosh, could it be that fundamentalist Christians dislike ALL other religions? It would seem reasonable, but since the apologist group behind the study wants to create a specific link, that aspect is not discussed.\n\nFinally, notice the point about Americans not knowing about Islam. That's true. What the creators of the apologia miss is that helps them. For instance, a lot of Americans claim Muslims want peace while the group claims most Muslims want equality. However, the Organization of the Islamic Conferences, representing fifty-seven Muslim nations, openly rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and unanimously proposed The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. That claims that the only rights that exist are the ones Muslims grant people through Sharia law.\n\nThat is not equality, that is not peaceful, that is reality -- A reality neither Patel nor the folks who massaged the polls want people to see.\n\nPosted by: groucho42 | January 27, 2010 1:38 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nIslam is a gutter 'religion' that promotes death, violence, and the subjugation of women.\n\nPosted by: tjhall1 | January 27, 2010 1:25 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\n\u00c2\u00abPeople who hate Jews also hate Muslims.\u00c2\u00bb Posted by Eboo Patel | January 25, 2010; 9:28 AM ET\n\nO Eboo, *some* people who hate Jews also hate Muslims.

There were people involved in those acts who felt God & Jesus were blessing their actions, but you didn't see the entire population jump up and say \"Doing this is God's will.\"\n\nWorld War One did not occur because of Christ, it occurred because a Serbian nationalist/irredentist/whatever-ist shot the Archduke Ferdinand. That in and of itself didn't cause the war - indeed, the upper circles of the Austrian government didn't exactly mourn the Archduke's passing. However, elements within the government saw an excellent excuse to engage in a war to destroy Serbia. That, and a mishmash of entangling alliances in Europe, led to a succession of declaration of wars when Austria went to war. Those were hardly the only factors involved - nationalism, unresolved territorial disputes, arms races, etc., all contributed as well. There was very little overt religious reasoning.\n\nThe nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not conducted because the Japanese weren't Christians. They were conducted because an invasion of the Home Islands ('mainland' Japan) had casualty estimates - for the Allies alone - ranging from the hundreds of thousands to the MILLIONS. Using the bombs would only put a few bomber crews and their fighter escorts at risk; and it was hoped that obliterating one or two cities would shock the Emperor into surrendering before the bloodbath of an invasion became necessary. Personally, I agree with Truman's decision to use atomic weapons.\n\nHolding all Christians responsible for such events would be like holding all Muslims responsible for the cowards who strap bombs to their chests and blow up unarmed civilians.

Muslims and Jews are very strongly monotheistic while Christians believe in a three pronged God. The central figure in Christianity is the God-Man figure of Jesus. Ask any Jew or Muslim if they believe that Jesus was God in human flesh who ran afoul of the authorities and was executed. They will most emphatically say that Jesus was a man and not a God. This is diametrically opposed to the central believ of Christianity. Each religion thinks it is the true one and that the others are misguided or downright false.

Indeed the new comer has paid the green-back dollars to acquire or rent that property but this fact is often overlooked. Old is gold, so think the older residents. The New may be Platinum for all you know. I don't care - that attitude is a road block in beginning a communication. One wonders why the friendly instinct of welcoming a new neighbour takes a back seat these days when you and I need it most. COMPASSION The youth is driven by Passion. If there is a sweet little chick in the new flock, the boys of nubile age think of dating her - not with the intention of taking her to altar but with the not so sacred instinct of taking her to bed sooner or later. That is not the human spirit. That is the animal instinct. We all behave as animals sometime or the other. It is the correct education that purifies and reforms our baser instincts and makes a man out of an animal. MANURBHAV The Vedas, most ancient scriptures in the library of mankind advise all men and women to be good Human Beings.Among the many qualities of a Human Being isCompassion or in Sanskrit, KARUNA. If my heart bleeds for the man or the woman next door when she needs help, I have risen to the status of a Human after sublimating my animal instincts. I have risen higher than what the old saying demanded of me. A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED - that is the age-old adage. Going to the help of a neighbour, a fellow man, even before making friends with him or her is a step higher than what was required of me, a neighbour, in the saying on friendship.Going into that direction further, one may even go to rescue a damsel in distress and that would indeed be an act of a good human being. One need not be a Knight in shining armor on a white horse to prove to the humanity his Humane qualities. This may be done in a lane or a bylane where the poor, the needy and the deprived men and women live. Let us obey the Vedic injunction \"MANURBHAV'and be true to our Dharma or the code of conduct to live and let live in a human society.God treats all human beings as His sons and daughters and does not differentiate between votaries of one religion and another. ______________________________ UPVANOM, 609, Sector 29, NOIDA - 201303, INDIA.

The Christians at one time had their own version of the Taliban. They were known as Crusaders. Before they became involved fighting Muslims, they hunted down and killed other Christians who they viewed as heretics. Many people cloak themselves in religion in order to justify their evil deeds. One of my more infamous ancestors coined the phrase, \"Kill them all - Let God sort them out,\" when he ordered the massacre of the entire population of a French town because he had heard that there were some heretics living in the town. Motivations have always seemed to be the same, e.g., power, wealth, and women, although I have no doubt that some cult leaders are criminally insane. Charismatic leaders always seem to draw in followers, many of whom seem to welcome religion as an excuse to abuse other people, and others who are misquided into thinking that they will reap great rewards in the hereafter.\n\nPosted by: FredinVicksburg | January 27, 2010 3:12 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nYassirYousufi: \"Kafir is a Ayyan Hirsi Ali Inspired Hindu whacko masquerading as a muslim apostate because he thinks it sounds cool to be an apostate and no body will be able to guess his true identity!\"\n\nI may be a vulcun or a klingon or even a 10 foot Navi.

In the case of Jews and Muslims, the conflict stems from each group having an entitlement agenda that is fundamentally incompatible with the other.\n\nThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that every individual who identifies themselves as a Muslim or a Jew necessarily subscribes to the group agenda. It just means that for Jews who do, they believe that their religious/ethnic identity entitles them to take possession of Israel/Palestine to the dispossession of others.\n\nFor Muslims, it is the entitlement to see that their religion is the predominant faith everywhere. It is the resistance to those agendas that engenders hatred and fuels conflict. The Muslims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agenda is much more comprehensive and is therefore perceived to be the greater threat to the world at large. Beyond that, there is the content of Islamic scripture, which features justification for many draconian social restrictions and sanctions.\n\nI would probably be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause if they were not wedded to a to a religious tradition that takes its intolerance seriously. Zionism is sort of like affirmative action to aid a group that has suffered much and could really use a safe haven.

We are at war with the Jihadist who in my opinion are the true believers of the words of the Quran, and are the one who reflect the ideology of Islam in its pure form. It is okay to hate those who kill because their ideology tells them to kill kaafirs. I have no desire to tolerate an Abdul Muttalib who wanted to kill the hundreds flying on that plane.

The facts are relatively straightforward compared to 9/11. If it could be shown that the anthrax attacks originated from the US government or agents thereof, it would produce a massive shift in the public's thinking.

Actually, this is making the problem of Islamic terrorism worse.\n\nOf course, people who happen to be born into a muslim family like Eboo Patel (or Yasseryousufi) will have the need to defend Islam because it is a part of their identity. Most people are good people. Most muslims are good people. But their are too many violent muslims today and throughout history. Good muslims are good in spite of the supremacist and narrow-minded ideology found in the Koran and Hadith. The good find the good in the Koran and ignore the bad, which is nice. The problem is there is too much justification for acts of violence against nonbelievers (kafirs) in the Koran and in the culture & history of Islam. This has to be addressed and cannot be ignored. step 1: ackowledge there is a problem. step 2: try to fix the problem.\n\nWe seem to be stuck on step 1 with the \"Rodney King\" approach. Please try to tell the Al Queda, Taliban & suicide bombers that \"we must reject hate\". Good Luck. Sadly, step 2 will also be a problem. If a few things in the Koran need to changed, can it be done? No. The Koran says many nice things, but it also says some bad and violent things regarding women & nonbelievers.

They are not in the same league.\n\nIt is a fatally false assumption that prejudice, per se, is a bad thing. We are prejudiced against Nazis, against white racists, against black racists, against Communists, against Ku Klux Klan members -- and everyone thinks that is perfectly o.k. And, it is o.k.!!! It is always o.k. to be prejudiced against members of a group and adherents of an ideology whose values are inimical to ours. Not only is it o.k.; but it is morally right. In the case of Islam, it is clear that Islamic values are inimical to ours. One need only read the Koran, the sayings of Muhammad, Sharia law and the writings of the great Islamic religious authorities, the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. When a person says that he/she is Moslem, it is reasonable to infer that this person accepts and promotes the doctrines of Islam which are based on violent religious bigotry toward all non-Moslems. Now, we know that there are many Moslems who do NOT favor those Islamic doctrines. They exist -- just like there were many members of the Nazi party and the Soviet Communist party who did not support the doctrines of those parties. The problem is: how do we know in advance which members of the group truly support the doctrines of the group? We cannot know in advance. That is where prejudice comes in. ALL members of a subversive group should be under suspicion of supporting the doctrines of that group -- until proven otherwise. Failure to exercise proper prejudice and suspicion has already cost us thousands of innocent lives -- think 9/11, Ft. Hood, the London bombing, the Madrid bombing, the Bali bombing, the Mumbai massacre, and so on and so on. Prejudice against members of a group, based on knowledge of the principles of the group, is perfectly reasonable. Let us work to educate Americans so that the percentage of those prejudiced against Moslems will increase! Those Moslems who do not share the violent religious bigotry of Islam can help us be being vocal about their rejection of those parts of the Koran, Hadith and Sharia which promote violent religious bigotry. Reasonable prejudice is a matter of life and death. It is elementary self-defense.\n\nPosted by: Montedoro | January 26, 2010 7:52 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nWell EP is trying to be egalitarian.

How many times have we seen reports of Imams spouting hatred from the pulpits of the world and nothing is done to stop them?

All religions seem to be opposed to the truly open society. The relative simplicity of Islamic theology--its greater rationality, if I might somewhat abuse the term, compared with, say, trinitarianism--supports a totalitarian vision of theocracy. Divinely led authorities can, of course, never be wrong. (Contrast this view with that of the Founders, who understood that people are fallible and that factions are corrupt and set ambition to check ambition, and created institutional checks to the assumption of total power.) With the recent report that al Qaeda is determined on a MWD attack in the US, it seems that al Qaeda is bent on an apocalyptic confrontation between Islam and the modern world.\n\nI would only point out that in the wake of a large-scale attack on the US, it would loom large in the thinking of whatever militant group eventually came to power that Meccans and Tehranis don't vote in American elections. Also that it is probably a lot easier to break a country than to take it over. There is a lot of anger in the US right now, and another big attack could easily result in a tea-party-type President committed to a fundamentalist apocalypticism.

Throughout the MIddle East, Asia, and parts of Africa antisemitism is part of the official discourse, present in local and state-run newspapers, television shows, in films, including the notorious Rothchild nonsense. The Protocols is standard fare.\n\nThe ranting against Christians both inside mosques and without, the oppression, the violence in Pakistan, Egypt, etc., is also everywhere present.\n\nNo rabbi would last two minutes if he began spouting hate from the \"pulpit\" against any group on the face of the earth. It may not be. It would be considered a defilement.\n\nWhen Muslims the world over take that same position, dialogue could open. Unfortunately, those who attempt it are often the victims of oppression, occasionally serious.\n\nIn the meantime, Eboo, I would be interested in knowing your thoughts about the displacement, forced exile of the remaining Jews of Yemen.\n\nI can also tell you this. I loathe bigotry with every fiber that comprises my being. HOwever, I long ago recognized that one does not fight fire with a cup of water. For Jews, the house is always on fire or about to be burned.\n\nFrance will be Judenrein in my lifetime. Jews are slowly leaving England. Why is that Eboo? Let's be friends would be great.

The single highest predictor of prejudice against Muslims is prejudice against Jews.\n\nLet's make this as personal as possible. When someone in your synagogue says something ugly about Muslims, know that he is marshaling the forces of anti-Semitism. When someone in your mosque speaks hatefully about Jews, know that he is putting your Muslim children more at risk.\n\nFor the purposes of prejudice, the terms 'dirty Muslim' and 'dirty Jew' are virtually interchangeable.

However Pakistan is riven with sectarian hate, and many even consider the 15% of the population who are shia as kaafirs. The shia are blasted regularly around the country. Since Ismailis are part of the shia, in that sense they are also killed by the true believers among the Sunnis. However, Agha Khan, the Imam of the Ismailis is accorded state honors and welcomed as a muslim by the Pakisan Government, the OIC, the Saudi Monarchy, etc.\n\nPosted by: AKafir | January 28, 2010 1:57 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nDo you doubt the figure i quoted?

But I doubt it is for religous reasons. They come done even harder on islamists than on these apostates. Summary executions and life imprisonments is a norm for muslim brotherhood activists. Islam has already declared that there is no compulsion in religion!\n\nI can speak for Pakistan, we consider Ismailis and Ahmedis as apostates. They are a recognized minority and are present in influential Government positions. The Christians are free to build their Churches, carry out their religous practice freely, they have job quotas and reserved seats in the parliament which is in addition to what they can get on their own.\n\nYour hatefilled rant speaks volumes of your ignorance. Dhimmism used to be practiced during middle ages. During that time the Christian Crusaders used to kill all muslim prisoners in any territory they occupied and even ate those people (Ma'arrat al-Numan!). I found Dhimmism to be a just system, but thats a debate for another day. The fact of the matter is that there is no Dhimmism around these days.\n\nThere was no rejection of the UDHR by muslim delegates. The current UDHR is based upon Judeo-Christian Principles. There is nothing wrong with muslim countries demanding that their sensibilities also be taken into account just as those of Jews and Christians. In a democratic system there is nothing wrong in demanding your rights. If the majority of UN feels that this demand is unjustified I believe the muslims would move on. But there's nothing wrong in asking is it?\n\nSo how many muslim countries have you been to? You make pretty stupid generalising statements about status of minorities.

The \"Abrahamic faiths\" aren't quite the same, especially in their view of Abraham.\n\nWhile Christianity accepts the Torah as the Old Testament and just says a new word came through Jesus, Islam claims something else. They rewrote both books, saying Christianity and Judaism lied about Abraham, Moses, Jesus and much of the rest of the books.\n\nIslam has a very different interpretation and it can't be lumped in the same category as Judaism and Christianity.\n\nBoth Islam and Judaism (and, thus, Christianity) are considered \"Abrahamic faiths,\" in that they stem from a connection to Abraham as described in the Torah, the Bible, and the Qu'ran. Since Islam is predominantly an Arabic religion, it has been concluded that Islam stems from Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham and half-brother of Isaac father of Jacob (later named Israel).\n\nThe following verses from Quran proves the point ....\n\nAnd He(Allah) taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: \"Tell me the names of these if ye are right.\" ( Quran,Al-Baqara, Chapter #2, Verse #31)\n\nAllah did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of 'Imran above all people,- ( Quran,Aal-e-Imran, Chapter #3, Verse #33)\n\nWe(Allah) have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. ( Quran,An-Nisa, Chapter #4, Verse #163)\n\nAnd remember We(Allah) took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant: ( Quran,Al-Ahzab, Chapter #33, Verse #7)\n\nThe only \"ignorance\" here is Christians trying to disown Islam as a part of their intolerant common Abrahamic \"my-way-or-the highway\" denominator.\n\nPosted by: coloradodog | January 27, 2010 11:05 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nHirsi Ali says it well: ************* http://www.aei.org/article/100627 Nowhere in the world is bigotry so rampant as in Muslim countries. No difference is greater between American and Islamic principles than the founding ideals of both. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of Islam that al-Qa'ida and other Muslim puritans insist on the implementation of sharia law, jihad and the eternal subjection of women. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of America that blacks and women fought for--and gained--equal rights and gays and new immigrants continue to do so.\n\nI would include Thomas Jefferson's improvements on the New Testament. The king, the sheik and the ayatollah have the authority to rule that parts of the Koran no longer apply in the modern world. For instance, the edicts of sharia law that reject scientific inquiry and order all Muslims to spread Islam.\n\nAnd of course, no reading selection would be complete without a copy of the US Constitution, highlighting (because you can do that in a Kindle) the Eighth Amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAnd for good measure, I would also add John F.Kennedy's inaugural address: \"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. . . . To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required. . . . To those nations who would make themselves our adversary . . . we dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. . . . Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\" Not to mention woman.\n\nI wish he [Obama] would host a reading summit where we truly \"say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts that too often are said only behind closed doors\".

Infidels under Muslim rule are ritually and legally mistreated in the name of Allah by Sharia law. Muslims have proudly documented the long history of such Dhimmitude and they were the ones who first made Jews wear yellow symbols of identification on clothing, long before Germany did.\n\nIslam has three ordered choices it offers conquered infidels: Conversion, acceptance of Dhimmi status and death. Is it any real wonder why many of the indigenous people conquered by Jihad accepted conversion in order to escape the later two choices?\n\nThat also goes back to one of my original points. There's no such thing a \"moderate Islamic countries\" when all unanimously reject the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and support The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam.

Sadly, he shows that statistics is another area of ignorance.As the main body of people hating Jews today is the Muslim World, his initial presence falls flat on its face.\n\nSadly, though, Patel's main problem isn't ignorance, it's intentional propaganda, his usual tool. Go to the link he gives for the poll. Look at the chart on page 7. The responders seem to dislike Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism at around the same percentage. Yes, Christianity is in the mix. Muslims, on the other had, are disliked at a much higher rate.\n\nCould it be because Jihad declared a war on the West and Muslims have been killing and trying to kill us for decades? No, says Patel, it's because we also hate Jews. Sorry, doesn't follow.\n\nOn page eight, they switch from the religions to people who follow the religion. The pattern remains. There's a major statistical difference between dislike of Muslims and the other religious adherents.\n\nOn page 13, the study tries to link the prejudice against Jews with that against Muslims. Notice a religion disappears: Buddhism. Gosh, could it be that fundamentalist Christians dislike ALL other religions? It would seem reasonable, but since the apologist group behind the study wants to create a specific link, that aspect is not discussed.\n\nFinally, notice the point about Americans not knowing about Islam. That's true. What the creators of the apologia miss is that helps them. For instance, a lot of Americans claim Muslims want peace while the group claims most Muslims want equality. However, the Organization of the Islamic Conferences, representing fifty-seven Muslim nations, openly rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and unanimously proposed The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. That claims that the only rights that exist are the ones Muslims grant people through Sharia law.\n\nThat is not equality, that is not peaceful, that is reality -- A reality neither Patel nor the folks who massaged the polls want people to see.\n\nPosted by: groucho42 | January 27, 2010 1:38 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nIslam is a gutter 'religion' that promotes death, violence, and the subjugation of women.\n\nPosted by: tjhall1 | January 27, 2010 1:25 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\n\u00c2\u00abPeople who hate Jews also hate Muslims.\u00c2\u00bb Posted by Eboo Patel | January 25, 2010; 9:28 AM ET\n\nO Eboo, *some* people who hate Jews also hate Muslims.

However, elements within the government saw an excellent excuse to engage in a war to destroy Serbia. That, and a mishmash of entangling alliances in Europe, led to a succession of declaration of wars when Austria went to war. Those were hardly the only factors involved - nationalism, unresolved territorial disputes, arms races, etc., all contributed as well. There was very little overt religious reasoning.\n\nThe nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not conducted because the Japanese weren't Christians. They were conducted because an invasion of the Home Islands ('mainland' Japan) had casualty estimates - for the Allies alone - ranging from the hundreds of thousands to the MILLIONS. Using the bombs would only put a few bomber crews and their fighter escorts at risk; and it was hoped that obliterating one or two cities would shock the Emperor into surrendering before the bloodbath of an invasion became necessary. Personally, I agree with Truman's decision to use atomic weapons.\n\nHolding all Christians responsible for such events would be like holding all Muslims responsible for the cowards who strap bombs to their chests and blow up unarmed civilians. Do people do it? Yes. Is it right? No.\n\nPosted by: SeaTigr | January 27, 2010 11:54 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nBy the way a Muslim country Turkey, the Ottoman empire was part of WWI - if you are going to defend Islam as peaceful know your history - the Turks committed atrocities against the christian people under their thumb for hundreds of years.\n\nIts called Prima Noctura - rape the christian bride on her wedding night - if we want to talk history its going to get worse and worse.\n\nPosted by: agapn9 | January 27, 2010 11:52 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nMuslims have a very aggressive culture.

Muslims and Jews are very strongly monotheistic while Christians believe in a three pronged God. The central figure in Christianity is the God-Man figure of Jesus. Ask any Jew or Muslim if they believe that Jesus was God in human flesh who ran afoul of the authorities and was executed. They will most emphatically say that Jesus was a man and not a God. This is diametrically opposed to the central believ of Christianity. Each religion thinks it is the true one and that the others are misguided or downright false. The other major religions (Hinduism for example) have an entirely different idea of God. Let's stop repeating the nonsense that we all worship the same God.

The koran CLEARLY states that all religions should be respected. Jews think that they are suffering...ok lets flip the numbers than. We will kill one jew for each palestinian that has died. Do you honestly think that the numbers of jews killed to the numbers of palestinians is even remotely close? Im not talking about the holocaust, im talking about israel vs palestine. Please stop reading the koran if all your going to do is translate it the wrong way. Israel will always be mad about the holocaust. well guess what, who cares?

Now that they do, they are causing trouble throughout the region which was once much more stable, before the ww2.

Indeed the new comer has paid the green-back dollars to acquire or rent that property but this fact is often overlooked. Old is gold, so think the older residents. The New may be Platinum for all you know. I don't care - that attitude is a road block in beginning a communication. One wonders why the friendly instinct of welcoming a new neighbour takes a back seat these days when you and I need it most. COMPASSION The youth is driven by Passion. If there is a sweet little chick in the new flock, the boys of nubile age think of dating her - not with the intention of taking her to altar but with the not so sacred instinct of taking her to bed sooner or later. That is not the human spirit. That is the animal instinct. We all behave as animals sometime or the other. It is the correct education that purifies and reforms our baser instincts and makes a man out of an animal. MANURBHAV The Vedas, most ancient scriptures in the library of mankind advise all men and women to be good Human Beings.Among the many qualities of a Human Being isCompassion or in Sanskrit, KARUNA. If my heart bleeds for the man or the woman next door when she needs help, I have risen to the status of a Human after sublimating my animal instincts. I have risen higher than what the old saying demanded of me. A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED - that is the age-old adage. Going to the help of a neighbour, a fellow man, even before making friends with him or her is a step higher than what was required of me, a neighbour, in the saying on friendship.Going into that direction further, one may even go to rescue a damsel in distress and that would indeed be an act of a good human being. One need not be a Knight in shining armor on a white horse to prove to the humanity his Humane qualities. This may be done in a lane or a bylane where the poor, the needy and the deprived men and women live. Let us obey the Vedic injunction \"MANURBHAV'and be true to our Dharma or the code of conduct to live and let live in a human society.God treats all human beings as His sons and daughters and does not differentiate between votaries of one religion and another. ______________________________ UPVANOM, 609, Sector 29, NOIDA - 201303, INDIA.

That ideology has mass murderers (Osama Bin Laden), ordinary murderers (abortion doctor killers and those who deprive sick children of medical care) and garden variety haters (Pat Robertson and his ilk). Only rarely do mainstream religious leaders fight back or even condemn this evil. They do not do so because under the hood of every religious belief in the world is the theological notion that \"I am right. I know God's will and you are therefore wrong.\" Fundamentalism assaulted will yield religion destroyed is the unspoken fear. So the great churches sit in silence.

Before they became involved fighting Muslims, they hunted down and killed other Christians who they viewed as heretics. Many people cloak themselves in religion in order to justify their evil deeds. One of my more infamous ancestors coined the phrase, \"Kill them all - Let God sort them out,\" when he ordered the massacre of the entire population of a French town because he had heard that there were some heretics living in the town. Motivations have always seemed to be the same, e.g., power, wealth, and women, although I have no doubt that some cult leaders are criminally insane.

In the case of Jews and Muslims, the conflict stems from each group having an entitlement agenda that is fundamentally incompatible with the other.\n\nThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that every individual who identifies themselves as a Muslim or a Jew necessarily subscribes to the group agenda. It just means that for Jews who do, they believe that their religious/ethnic identity entitles them to take possession of Israel/Palestine to the dispossession of others.\n\nFor Muslims, it is the entitlement to see that their religion is the predominant faith everywhere. It is the resistance to those agendas that engenders hatred and fuels conflict. The Muslims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agenda is much more comprehensive and is therefore perceived to be the greater threat to the world at large. Beyond that, there is the content of Islamic scripture, which features justification for many draconian social restrictions and sanctions.\n\nI would probably be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause if they were not wedded to a to a religious tradition that takes its intolerance seriously. Zionism is sort of like affirmative action to aid a group that has suffered much and could really use a safe haven. Materially, the loss of Palestine is fairly inconsequential, but the land loss is secondary to the insult to the Muslim identity.\n\nPosted by: SCKershaw | January 27, 2010 2:04 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nThe Christians truly do have a history of monstrous violence, but it's pretty much just that - history.\n\nThe Muslim killing and enslaving is current events.\n\nYou Sir, take away the prize of the most ignorant commentator of the day.\n\nHalf a million dead Iraqi children, a direct consequence of sanctions imposed by the Christian West.

Anti-semitism is hatred of a \"people\", of real people who can get hurt. The equivalent would be hatred of muslims, and around the world the non-muslims bend over backword to show that their cultures and their ideologies do not even discriminate against muslims. This is opposed to the deeply deeply biased and discriminatory laws on the books of all Islamic countries against the non-muslims.\n\nI am an apostate of Islam and I think it is justified to criticize and expose the hatred against the Kaafir that is imbedded in Islam. Hating Islam is hating an ideology. It is okay to hate Nazism. It is okay to hate Islam. It is not okay to generalize that to the people, the muslims. We are at war with the Jihadist who in my opinion are the true believers of the words of the Quran, and are the one who reflect the ideology of Islam in its pure form. It is okay to hate those who kill because their ideology tells them to kill kaafirs. I have no desire to tolerate an Abdul Muttalib who wanted to kill the hundreds flying on that plane. What ever ideology drove him to want to kill those people should be hated. He says that that ideology is Islam.

The facts are relatively straightforward compared to 9/11. If it could be shown that the anthrax attacks originated from the US government or agents thereof, it would produce a massive shift in the public's thinking.

Most people are good people. Most muslims are good people. But their are too many violent muslims today and throughout history. Good muslims are good in spite of the supremacist and narrow-minded ideology found in the Koran and Hadith. The good find the good in the Koran and ignore the bad, which is nice. The problem is there is too much justification for acts of violence against nonbelievers (kafirs) in the Koran and in the culture & history of Islam. This has to be addressed and cannot be ignored. step 1: ackowledge there is a problem. step 2: try to fix the problem.\n\nWe seem to be stuck on step 1 with the \"Rodney King\" approach.

No. The Koran says many nice things, but it also says some bad and violent things regarding women & nonbelievers.

They are not in the same league.\n\nIt is a fatally false assumption that prejudice, per se, is a bad thing. We are prejudiced against Nazis, against white racists, against black racists, against Communists, against Ku Klux Klan members -- and everyone thinks that is perfectly o.k. And, it is o.k.!!! It is always o.k. to be prejudiced against members of a group and adherents of an ideology whose values are inimical to ours. Not only is it o.k.; but it is morally right. In the case of Islam, it is clear that Islamic values are inimical to ours. One need only read the Koran, the sayings of Muhammad, Sharia law and the writings of the great Islamic religious authorities, the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. When a person says that he/she is Moslem, it is reasonable to infer that this person accepts and promotes the doctrines of Islam which are based on violent religious bigotry toward all non-Moslems. Now, we know that there are many Moslems who do NOT favor those Islamic doctrines. They exist -- just like there were many members of the Nazi party and the Soviet Communist party who did not support the doctrines of those parties. The problem is: how do we know in advance which members of the group truly support the doctrines of the group? We cannot know in advance. That is where prejudice comes in. ALL members of a subversive group should be under suspicion of supporting the doctrines of that group -- until proven otherwise. Failure to exercise proper prejudice and suspicion has already cost us thousands of innocent lives -- think 9/11, Ft. Hood, the London bombing, the Madrid bombing, the Bali bombing, the Mumbai massacre, and so on and so on. Prejudice against members of a group, based on knowledge of the principles of the group, is perfectly reasonable. Let us work to educate Americans so that the percentage of those prejudiced against Moslems will increase! Those Moslems who do not share the violent religious bigotry of Islam can help us be being vocal about their rejection of those parts of the Koran, Hadith and Sharia which promote violent religious bigotry. Reasonable prejudice is a matter of life and death. It is elementary self-defense.\n\nPosted by: Montedoro | January 26, 2010 7:52 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nWell EP is trying to be egalitarian.

All religions seem to be opposed to the truly open society. The relative simplicity of Islamic theology--its greater rationality, if I might somewhat abuse the term, compared with, say, trinitarianism--supports a totalitarian vision of theocracy. Divinely led authorities can, of course, never be wrong. (Contrast this view with that of the Founders, who understood that people are fallible and that factions are corrupt and set ambition to check ambition, and created institutional checks to the assumption of total power.) With the recent report that al Qaeda is determined on a MWD attack in the US, it seems that al Qaeda is bent on an apocalyptic confrontation between Islam and the modern world.\n\nI would only point out that in the wake of a large-scale attack on the US, it would loom large in the thinking of whatever militant group eventually came to power that Meccans and Tehranis don't vote in American elections. Also that it is probably a lot easier to break a country than to take it over. There is a lot of anger in the US right now, and another big attack could easily result in a tea-party-type President committed to a fundamentalist apocalypticism.

It may not be. It would be considered a defilement.\n\nWhen Muslims the world over take that same position, dialogue could open.

Keep up-to-date on global religious developments with On Faith."]}, {"title": ["How international relations got religion, and got it wrong"], "text": ["This post is part of the \u201cIslam and International Order\u201d symposium.\n\nTwenty years ago, most scholars of international relations viewed religion as private and irrelevant to global politics. Today, that has profoundly changed. Everyone seems to be measuring, analyzing and alternately promoting and constraining religion in all manner of forms. Policymakers seek out representatives of moderate religion to create peaceable partnerships, while co-opting or sidelining their rivals. Scholars and advocacy networks model relations between religion and democracy, religion and peacebuilding, and religion and economic growth.\n\nThis new attention to religion is, at its base, predominantly about Islam. From 9/11 to the rise of the Islamic State, the \u201cproblem\u201d that Islam is said to represent has led to a moral panic in Western democracies.\n\nIslam is portrayed as the religion that is most recalcitrant and most resistant to Western-style modernity. It is seen as an agent that \u2014 like other religions, only more so \u2014 needs careful management to prevent it from igniting into violence.\n\nScholars and experts in the United States and abroad have built careers around reiterating the mantra that Islam must be reformed in the interest of world peace.\n\nIslam is also seen as its own potential solution, as long as moderation is institutionalized, extremists marginalized and the tradition\u2019s benevolent tendencies harnessed for the public good. \u201cGood\u201d forms of Islam are celebrated as sources of morality, community and discipline, while \u201cbad\u201d ones are criticized as the root of all global instability and insecurity. As Andrew Shyrock puts it, \u201cMuslims and particular forms of Islam are understood, with varying degrees of anxiety and affection, as problems that must be solved, or as solutions to problems.\u201d\n\nEfforts by scholars to engage with the public discourse surrounding Islam have proven frustrating. As Jillian Schwedler observed earlier this year, the perceived need to defend the \u201cmoderation\u201d of Islam in the public policy debate can leave scholars trapped within unsophisticated and corrosive categories. The sterility of debates such as whether inclusion of Islamists moderates them or whether the Islamic State is truly Islamic, led Schwedler to argue for the need to \u201cmake explicit the ways in which certain categories have dominated our analyses and think through whether or not there is more insight to be gained by refining or by abandoning them.\u201d The same stance should now be adopted by those engaged with the public arguments over religious freedom and calls to reform Islam.\n\nReligious freedom, particularly with regard to Islam, has evolved into a major policy arena. In the United States, this logic is institutionalized in the State Department\u2019s Office of International Religious Freedom and the Office of Religion and Global Affairs, with a supporting cast of nongovernmental initiatives, memos and conferences dedicated to supporting moderation, religious freedom, and toleration while countering violent extremism at home and abroad. The latter is especially prevalent since the rise of the Islamic State.\n\nLast week, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) introduced the Countering Violent Extremism Act to create a federal Office of Coordination for Countering Violent Extremism at the Department of Homeland Security. The bill defines violent extremism as \u201cideologically motivated terrorist activities.\u201d\n\nThis agenda is also intensifying in Canada and in Europe, reflecting a growing global consensus that extremist \u201cbad\u201d religion is the problem and moderate \u201cgood\u201d religion the solution. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced an increase in defense spending of nearly 4 billion euros between 2016 and 2020 to confront extremist threats at home and overseas. The European Parliament and the Canadian government have created offices\u2014such as the Canadian Office of International Religious Freedom and the European Parliament Intergroup on Freedom of Religion or Belief and Religious Tolerance \u2014 to conduct outreach to religious leaders, protect religious minorities, promote tolerant religion and counter extremism.\n\nThe problem is that the understanding of religion underlying these efforts is deeply flawed. Religion, law and politics have always intermingled \u2014 and it cannot be otherwise. As Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar argues in this series, religious interpretations are often an outcome of politics. Religion cannot be disembedded and isolated from the broader social and political fields in which it is entangled. It also cannot be divided between good and bad. There are no untouched religions waiting to be recovered from political irrelevance or reformed into peaceable governing partners.\n\nReligions, including Islam, do not cause violence. Nor do they cause peace. Religion is better understood as are other intersected categories such as gender, race and class: it is deeply enmeshed with legal forms of collective governance in complex and context-specific formations. The religious-secular opposition is itself unstable, shaped by social forces, institutions and practices that cannot be reduced to either of the two sides of the binary. Religion occupies different spaces under modern regimes of governance, some of which are often described as \u201csecular.\u201d\n\nMy new book, \u201cBeyond Religious Freedom,\u201d proposes a new vocabulary for the study of religion and governance. Distinguishing between \u201cexpert religion,\u201d \u201cofficial religion,\u201d and \u201clived religion,\u201d it disaggregates religion in order to access a richer field of religio-political realities. Taking Islam as an example, \u201clived\u201d Islam would refer to the practices of ordinary Muslims as they interact with religious authorities, rituals, texts and institutions as they seek to navigate and make sense of their lives, connections with others and place in the world. It identifies a diverse field of human activity, relations, investments and beliefs that may or may not be captured in the set of human goings-on identified as \u201cIslamic\u201d for the purposes of law and governance. \u201cGoverned\u201d or \u201cofficial\u201d Islam, on the other hand, is religion as construed by those in positions of political and religious power, including the state and various forms of law. Examples include the official Islam of state institutions \u2014 such as the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs, the Turkish Diyanet, the French foreign ministry, and the Egyptian state\u2014as well as the official Islams of various supranational institutions \u2014 including the International Criminal Court, the European Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\n\nFinally, \u201cexpert\u201d Islam refers to Islam as construed by those who generate knowledge about Islam including scholars, policy experts, religious authorities and government officials.\n\nDisaggregating Islam into these three categories reveals that expert and official construals of Islam do not and cannot exhaust the field of contemporary Muslim religiosities. Lived Islam does not align with an understanding of Islam as a singular, bounded cause of political behavior. It often diverges from Islam as construed by the Turkish, Egyptian, French, Saudi \u2014 or American \u2014 state. The practices and traditions of lived Islam often dissent from orthodox, elite or official understandings of what Islam is or should be.\n\nNeither \u201cIslam\u201d nor \u201cMuslim political actors\u201d are singular, agentive forces that can be analyzed, quantified, engaged, celebrated, condemned, or divided between good and bad. References to \u201cMuslim political behavior\u201d should be met with skepticism. To rely for policy purposes on the category of an Islamic actor or Islamic state, as does the U.S. initiative on Countering Violent Extremism, mistakenly presumes a form of actor-ship motivated by Islam. This is sociologically untenable.\n\nThere is no singular Islam, just as there is no single Christianity or Hinduism. As anthropologist Samuli Schielke explains, \u201cIslam, like any major faith, is not simply something \u2013 it is a part of people\u2019s lives, thoughts, acts, societies, histories and more. Consequently, it can be many different things \u2013 a moral idiom, a practice of self-care, a discursive tradition, an aesthetic sensibility, a political ideology, a mystical quest, a source of hope, a cause of anxiety, an identity, an enemy \u2013 you name it.\u201d\n\nSingling out Islam as a cause of political behavior and a platform for conducting foreign policy obscures the broader and always entangled economic, historical, geographic, political and religious contexts in which discrimination, violence and coexistence occur. We lose sight of the bigger picture. Social tensions and conflicts that have roots in multiple contributing factors are depoliticized, their causes explained away through reference to intolerant theologies.\n\nThe recent debate over whether the Islamic State is Islamic is one example. As Anver Emon explains, the moral panic surrounding the Islamic State arises out of a context in which the \u201cIslamic\u201d is being rendered as an ideology to respond to a broader history of political, economic and social frustration and dispossession. Emon posits: \u201csuppose instead of asking whether ISIS is Islamic, we were to say that ISIS is as much Islamic as it is a product of broken promises at the end of the British and French mandates; ISIS is as much Islamic as it is a product of the American interventions in Iraq; ISIS\u2019s brutality is as Islamic as the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s lynching of Black Americans was Christian, both Islam and Christianity having been used to justify violent brutality.\u201d\n\nDisaggregating religion highlights the gaps between the constructs of religious governance \u2014 such as religious freedom, religious outreach and interfaith dialogue \u2014 authorized by experts, states and other authorities, and the lived experiences of the individuals and communities they aspire to govern.\n\nDifferentiating between expert, governed and lived religion also highlights a dangerous trend of tying \u201cexpert religion\u201d to state power in the age of the so-called war on extremism.\n\nToday, on a scale not seen since the height of the Cold War, expert religion is being mobilized in the service of governed religion \u2014 and the aims of the state. A new partnership between the State Department and the American Academy of Religion (AAR), for example, announces that State is \u201ckeenly interested in drawing upon the insight of scholars of religion to help formulate and implement US foreign policy. In support of this vital effort, \u2026 [t]hese fellowships provide a wonderful opportunity to offer your expertise toward reducing violent conflict, improving regional security and protecting human rights.\u201d\n\nExperts who study religion have an important role to play in educating students and informing the public. Informed public engagement and writing on these issues is critical inside Washington and beyond. However, there is an important distinction to be made here. Peddling scholarly wares in the service of the state is not equivalent to writing and speaking in an effort to inform public debates. The former, as in the AAR-State partnership, inevitably involves pressing that power\u2019s case. The latter, as in Schwedler\u2019s analysis mentioned earlier, does not. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs, Charles King wrote that \u201cdemocratic societies depend on having a cadre of informed professionals outside government\u2014people in universities, think tanks, museums, and research institutes who cultivate expertise protected from the pressures of the state.\u201d Nowhere is restraint, reflection and understanding protected from the immediate interests of the state more urgently needed today than at the intersection of religion and global politics.\n\nFrom academic institutions to government bureaucracies, our understandings of law, politics, history and more need to pay careful attention to religion, but it cannot be imagined as a variable, or as an agent segregated from other dimensions of human sociality.\n\nBureaucracies do not need independent offices predicated on the notion that religions are entities set apart from the world requiring special treatment. To presume that religion is a stable category of law and governance decreases our capacity to understand complex conflicts. It favors forms of religion authorized by those in power, and it excludes other ways of being and belonging.\n\nElizabeth Shakman Hurd is an associate professor of politics at Northwestern University. Her forthcoming book, \u201cBeyond Religious Freedom: The New Global Politics of Religion,\u201d (Princeton University Press, 2015) examines how state-sponsored initiatives including international religious freedom advocacy, development assistance and nation building, and international law codify and restrict religion."], "summary": ["Religions, including Islam, do not cause violence. Nor do they cause peace. Religion is better understood as are other intersected categories such as gender, race and class."]}, {"title": ["What would George Washington say about Islam in USA?"], "text": ["With all the loud clamoring about the proposed Islamic Center to be built near Ground Zero, reasonable voices are hard to discern. One thing is clear: this is not a debate about religious freedom. A mosque by peaceful Muslims of good will, unrelated to perpetrating the 9/11 attacks has every right to exist anywhere on these shores. It is the worst form of religious intolerance--and very un-American--to think that one form of religion has limits on where and when it may be practiced.\n\nFirst a caveat: If there is any validity to the charges that the affiliations of principals or the finances of Cordoba House are questionable or linked in any way to terrorists, then there are other legal mechanisms to prevent such a law-breaking.\n\nFar from stopping purported terrorist sympathizers, however, the debates so far have only shown our ugly side.\n\nSarah Palin ignited the flames when she posted a series of inflammatory tweets and an explanatory note on Facebook calling for Muslims to consider not \"rubbing it in\" to the victims of 9/11.\n\nFair enough, if what was proposed was a shrine to Osama bin Laden or al Quaeda. In a dubious bit of logic, Palin proposes that the 9/11 terrorists, coming from an Islamic background, must necessarily taint all Muslim belief and practice such that any Islamic religious practice anywhere near the WTC site is unseemly and immoral. I guess any religion similar to Timothy McVeigh's needs to vacate Oklahoma City. This also leaves out the fact that a significant number of Muslim Americans are counted among the victims of the tragedy. They were among the workers trapped in the buildings.\n\nBut then Newt Gingrich came along and made Palin's misguided argument look downright plain. Gingrich offered up this whopper:\n\nSo much for Gingrich-style American exceptionalism.\n\nThe obvious preposterousness of his assertion defies imagining someone as smart as Gingrich could utter it. Our Constitutional order is grounded not as a counterpoint to the practices of Saudi Arabia but on the basis of what we have long held dear about each individual's dignity and liberties. Religious freedom on these shores is not dependent on the goodwill and blessings of mullahs or priests or politicians--indeed our constitutional protections declare this sacred right in spite of what the passions of the day may indicate is favored or disfavored religion. Americans should proclaim religious liberty and condemn its absence elsewhere, not use the examples of other nations as justifications for our own intolerance.\n\nShame on Gingrich for such a stupid, unhistorical, and un-American statement. And, by the way, he's wrong about the rebuilding, too. The site is well on its way to being rebuilt and you can watch it all be reborn here at the Project Rebirth website.\n\nFor those who want to say this mosque represents Islamic supremacy and must be stopped: how and on what grounds? What is your legislative strategy? ANY legislation that hints of targeting a group as religious in order to prevent them from doing something will be struck down (see Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993) if you want to find out why targeting a religion qua religion runs afoul of the Constitution).\n\nThis debate is not really about religious freedom, but shows the lingering and distressing tendency for the populace to harbor intolerance of certain religious groups who are not like the majority. Indeed, Gingrich lays bare the ugly truth: Muslims are lumped together into a group, and that group is suspected of being violent-prone and obedient to a religion that is inherently hostile to American values. Of course this is exacerbated by the violent acts of terror that some Muslims have perpetrated. Yet the fact is that some refuse to make distinctions between the vast majority of peaceful Muslims and those who are violent--a wide gulf exists between these groups. The majority of Muslim Americans (and Muslims around the globe) share the Abrahamic theism of most other Americans, participate in and believe in the many shared values, and hope for a better future for their families and communities. In spite of this, some loudly proclaim the inherent deficiencies of Islam and incite fear that all Muslims will take up violent means in their quest for world supremacy. We owe others a more careful assessment of their values and lives.\n\nBut don't take my word for it. Perhaps Palin and Gingrich and others who chatter about loving America and hating all Muslims might quiet themselves for a moment to reflect on the way that our first President -George Washington--treated the other disfavored tribe of Abrahamic descendents (the Jews) during his day.\n\nTurns out, he was quite the believer in freedom of religious practice and, more central to our point, decried religiously-based intolerance. Oh, and he vividly confirmed that the new American Republic was, if nothing else, the land of freedom for every believer to practice their religion and erect their houses of worship undeterred by those who sought to delegitimize their faiths.\n\nIn August 1790, President Washington, along with an entourage including Thomas Jefferson, visited Rhode Island to great fanfare. Part of his agenda was to promote the passage of the Bill of Rights (they needed to lobby individual states to ratify the Amendments, which included twelve amendments. The third of which became the first amendment protections of free exercise of religion, speech, and press after the first two proposed amendments failed to receive ratification by \u00c2\u00be of the states). During the visit, various officials offered speeches, including Moses Seixas who was the warden of Yeshuat Israel, the first Jewish congregation in Newport. The speech was preserved as a letter:\n\nPresident Washington, in reply a few days later, offered one of the most important visions of religious liberty for his new nation, recalling the context of oppression that his fellow children of Abraham's God had suffered by the intolerant many. Washington promised, with simple clarity, that these new United States would offer a haven for peaceful practitioners of all faiths:\n\nAs we consider the terrible tragedies of the terror attacks ten years prior and the ongoing war on terror--our own days of difficulty and danger--Washington's words ring just as true.\n\nBigotry has no sanction by our laws and each of us can live under our own vines and figtrees. Peaceful Muslims can and will build their Islamic centers just as Christians maintain or build their own churches and Jews worship in synagogues and gather in the Jewish community centers. Some of us will simply ponder the mysteries of life while walking in the woods.\n\nIf those who would do us harm try to find harbor in our midst, we can and should remove them like a cancer. But shared religious pasts, just like shared last names, do not define who we are. Rather, our words and deeds, our goals and values, and the labors we pursue will show each of our true intentions. We have nothing to fear from peaceful Muslims who seek peace and the dignity of others as people of good will. To ostracize them and tarnish their good works is nothing short of apostasy in the canon of American freedoms.\n\nBy Michael Kessler | July 28, 2010; 3:41 PM ET | Category: Just Law and Religion Save & Share: Previous: Bringing faith into the TB fight |\n\nThis author and his stupid article give a new meaning to the term revisionist PC jibberish.

The claims and justifications of what has been clearly a small group of psychotic individuals is insufficient to justify the conclusion. One would need strong evidence of support and aid across a large spectrum of Islamic society in the world to reach such a conclusion. The difficulty al qeada has in operating in any nation other then chaotic failed states belies reaching such a conclusion.\n\nMany people here point out certain Islamic practices found in many Islamic dominated countries in the world. Such practices are aborhint to us and can find no home here in the US therefore these people conclude Islam has no home here in the US. I would point out that almost all of these countries are non-industrialized and tribaly organized states. The practices found in such cultures are almost always incapatible with customes in the US. Regadles of religion. Islamic people when transplanted here in the US almost always lose these practices or the practicioners leave the country or end up in jail.

First i make it clear that mosques are not places of peaceful worship, they are citadels for muslim armies where they provoke the muslims to fight for something but mostly against non-muslims. They are not peaceful places of worship. All terrorsists are indoctrinated in mosques. So US should not allow construction of any mosque anywhere based on it's use. There is a mosque in Vatican city -it is muslims triumph over a free society while they don't allow any church or temple in their holy cities like Mecca or Medina. They don't even allow non-muslims to keep pictures of their gods. A very intolerant and violent cult. Islam is not a peaceful religion, its a cult following medieval beliefs and thrives on fear and force/violence and promotes violence against non-muslims through their books and Imams. And biggest violence is against their own women, treating them like slaves. So allowing a mosque for such cult is anti democracy, means you approve of that violent cult. Have muslims all over the world have ever tried to discard the old and medieval things out of their cult and modernize while Christians and Hindus have discarded old and useless things from their religion and embraced modern form of their religion which blends well with the lifestyles of the modern world.

Your main premise that Islam is that it is a religion like Baptist or Catholics or maybe like Judaism. Islam is theocracy; an ideology that does lump the state and religion into a one entity. It has rules for every minute aspect of life and most, if not all, run counter to the values enshrined in the USA constitution. Theirs is a supremacist ideology not unlike Nazism yet much more primitive, and intolerant of other worldviews. It is rigid and does not submit to amendments since its adherents firmly believe it is the exact literal words of Allah, the creator. Furthermore it is a proselytizing ideology and teaches that non-Muslims are infidels and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the duty of the believers to convert them by peaceful means if possible or by force if necessary. The harshest critics of this cult are ex-Muslims and their books are proliferating. It would be worth your time to read some of them.

To be an obedient Muslim, one has to attend at least once a week a mosque. The mosque can be anywhere, no Sharia interpretation requires it to be on 9/11 site. The desire to build there a mosque is hardly an act of good taste, even if the Constitution does not prohibit it. Probably most of the sons, daughters, fathers and mothers of the victims of 9/11 do not welcome it. Similarly, although perhaps the Constitution allows it, it would be a lack of good taste to build a monument in the memory of killed Wehrmacht soldiers in Arlington. Furthermore, it is doubtful that this is the wish of most Muslim Americans.

Further, those negative comments above further assume all Muslims are alike, and that there is collective guilt upon them all for the acts of the few. Islam is a flavor of Judeo-Christianity cum new Prophet. Allah is an Arabic word for the same concept as God/Gott/Dieu/etc. One could use the word Allah for God in Christian services, if so inclined. Islam is entitled to the same rights in the US as are Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Shintoism, and Hinduism, just to name a few. And it is unjust in the extreme to impute to all of Islam the deeds of Al Qaeda and the ilk.

Your main premise that Islam is that it is a religion like Baptist or Catholics or maybe like Judaism. Islam is theocracy; an ideology that does lump the state and religion into a one entity. It has rules for every minute aspect of life and most, if not all, run counter to the values enshrined in the USA constitution. Theirs is a supremacist ideology not unlike Nazism yet much more primitive, and intolerant of other worldviews. It is rigid and does not submit to amendments since its adherents firmly believe it is the exact literal words of Allah, the creator. Furthermore it is a proselytizing ideology and teaches that non-Muslims are infidels and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the duty of the believers to convert them by peaceful means if possible or by force if necessary. The harshest critics of this cult are ex-Muslims and their books are proliferating. It would be worth your time to read some of them.

Only 13 percent of likely Democratic caucus participants said they view Islam as inherently violent, compared with 39 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nReligion, age, and location were important factors in shaping respondents' views. \u201cThere are four demographic groups in which the dominant opinion is that Islam is inherently violent: those who describe themselves as very conservative (62 percent), seniors (53 percent), those who live in rural areas (52 percent), and born-again Christians (51 percent),\u201d said J. Ann Selzer, president of West Des Moines-based Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cThose are the constituencies that drive up the overall percentage among likely Republican caucus-goers.\u201d\n\nIn either party, Selzer said, \u201cthe majority do not damn the whole religion for the actions of a few.\u201d Still, among Republicans, \u201cyou have more than one in three that considers it a violent religion.\u201d\n\nCharles Coffey, 65, Garden Grove, Iowa, is in that group. The retired driver, who is Christian, said that \u201cover the centuries even those who know Christ as savior have committed acts of war. But the Islamic religion has basically been assaultive on society since day one: 'Either you agree with us or we'll destroy you.'\u201d In Coffey's view, extremists' acts of terrorism, plus what he sees as unfair treatment of women by Muslim men and governments, both seem to him to spring from the Islamic faith, though he added: \u201cDon't get me wrong, I don't know that terribly much about it.\u201d\n\nHe was surprised to learn his view isn't held by a majority of likely Republican caucus-goers in his state. \u201cYou're kidding me,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cI thought more people were paying attention than that.\u201d\n\nCoffey favors Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, the Republican frontrunner in the poll, saying that part of Walker's appeal is his reputation for not bowing to political correctness. Coffey said if he were to hear Walker talking about Islam being a peaceful religion, it would give him pause. \u201cI'd have to have second thoughts about that, I really would,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an appearance Sunday on ABC's This Week, Walker didn't address religion when he said he's open to sending U.S. troops to the Middle East to fight the Islamic State in a \u201csurgical\u201d operation. He said that \u201caggressively, we need to take the fight to ISIS and any other radical Islamic terrorist in and around the world\u201d and that it's not a question of where but when radicals attempt an attack on U.S. soil.\n\nTaking the opposite view from Coffey was Alex Bellings, 27, a customer-service worker from Coralville and likely Republican caucus-goer who sees Islam as a peaceful religion. Bellings, who studied international and religious studies in college, said he thinks age makes \u201ca big difference\u201d in people's viewpoints.\n\n\u201cI have a very good friend who is a member of the Islam faith,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, we've had many in-depth discussion about Islam and America. And I think taking classes in far Eastern religions and understanding the cultures has been very helpful to me in coming to my own conclusions about things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a majority of Republicans younger than age 45, 63 percent, said they viewed Islam as inherently peaceful. Those age 45 and older were evenly split, with 46 percent saying they thought the religion was inherently violent and and 45 percent saying they thought it was peaceful.\n\nBellings' early favorites among 2016 prospects are Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and minister. He said he likes Huckabee because \u201ceven though he carries his religion on his sleeve, it doesn't seem to get in the way of his making rational or well thought-out decisions.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Bellings said former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, another Christian conservative, doesn't appeal to him because it \u201cseems like religion is the driving force with every decision he makes.\u201d\n\nSantorum has been among the most outspoken potential candidates on the issue. In November at Virginia's Liberty University, he said Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u201chave given all Muslims a pass.\u201d Santorum added that \u201cI'm not saying that all Muslims are terrorists, nor do I say that all Muslims support terrorism,\u201d but that in his view the threat from Islamic terrorists to the U.S. is \u201crooted in the belief in an all-powerful God and has over a billion adherents who are taught that their faith supersedes all other faith. In one form or another, Islam has been warring with western civilization for 1,300 years.\u201d\n\nThe poll found a wider gap in the views of likely GOP caucus-goers who are women (35 percent say inherently violent, 56 percent say inherently peaceful) than among men (42-50). Similarly, those likely Republican caucus attendees with a college education were more likely to say the religion is inherently peaceful, 58-35, than those without a college education, who were basically tied, 44-45.\n\nWhere Iowa Republicans are divided, likely Democratic caucus-goers in the survey responded overwhelmingly with a view of inherently peaceful Islam that holds across gender, age, and educational differences. \u201cI've just always felt like most religions, if they follow the Golden Rule, they are inherently peaceful,\u201d said June McMahill, 79, a Hillary Clinton supporter. \u201cThere's always been extremists and radical elements, even in the Christian faith, the Crusades and those types of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn France, there's a backlash starting\u201d against Muslims, McMahill said. \u201cIt's bound to affect our thoughts and feelings, and I'm sure Republicans are going to be taking a tougher stance on it\u201d than Democrats.\n\n\u201cEveryone's going to have to raise their awareness, but not to the point of being phobic about it. You have to have some concern and not be blindsided but not be overreacting, either. Most of our Muslim people here are going to be fine, upstanding and just as concerned as the rest of us are,\u201d she said.\n\nShe thinks her views also are influenced by geography, she said. Her hometown, Glenwood, sits not far from the Nebraska line and Offutt Air Force Base, and as a result, \u201cmaybe we've been exposed a little bit more\u201d to diversity through the U.S. military, she said.\n\nDennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University in Des Moines, said voters' evolving views on Islam and its relationship to terrorism may well influence the debate, particularly in the Republican caucuses.

They worship at a mosque affiliated with the Nation of Islam. But at the Hebrew Language Academy, they fit right in.\n\nWhen state officials approved the school, critics wondered whether it would become a publicly financed religious school masquerading as a place open to everyone. And after a battle for space, it landed in a yeshiva.\n\nBut as the school\u2019s first year draws to a close, its classrooms are filled with a broad range of students, all seeming confident enough to jabber away as if they were elbowing their way down Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem. Perhaps surprisingly, the school has become one of the most racially mixed charter schools in the city. About a third of the 150 students are black, and several are Hispanic.\n\nThe school\u2019s organizers say it has been so successful that they plan to help create dozens like it, pledging to spend as much as $4.8 million next year to seed schools in Phoenix, Minneapolis and Manhattan Beach, Calif., in addition to one set to open next fall in East Brunswick, N.J.\n\nBut despite its diversity, the school still faces scrutiny over how it will handle religion and the complicated politics of the Middle East.\n\nCharter schools are publicly financed but privately run, and in some cases attract substantial private support. At Hebrew Language Academy, known as H.L.A., some backing comes from Michael H. Steinhardt, a retired hedge fund manager who has given away more than $200 million and is a supporter of Israel and Jewish causes.\n\nSome civil libertarians have criticized the school, saying that it is too difficult to navigate the church-state divide, particularly around Israel, a country with explicit ties to a religion.\n\n\u201cIsraelis themselves have a hard time around the question of whether Israel is a Jewish state or a democracy,\u201d said Charles C. Haynes, a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center in Washington. \u201cWhy would we want to involve a public school here in that question?\u201d\n\nMr. Steinhardt\u2019s daughter, Sara Berman, the chairwoman of the school\u2019s board, said that learning about Hebrew and Israeli culture was no different from learning about Bastille Day and baguettes in French class.\n\n\u201cThis is a dual-language school, contextualized by a rich culture,\u201d Ms. Berman said. \u201cTo say that you can\u2019t learn about what it is like to go to a shuk in Jerusalem because it\u2019s too complicated or tied to religion or politics, that\u2019s just not the case.\u201d\n\nStudents are just as likely to learn about Christmas or Ramadan as about Purim, and teachers say they check with the school\u2019s lawyers before veering into any lesson with ties to Judaism.\n\nIn one bow to the rules of religion, students are served kosher food from a local caterer.\n\nEach class has both an English and a Hebrew teacher. (There are three classes each in kindergarten and first grade, but the school plans to expand through the 12th grade.)\n\nStudents receive at least an hour of Hebrew instruction daily \u2014 the hallway is filled with ear-piercing shouts as the students learn that chicken is called auf and a cow is a parah.\n\n\u201cAt first my life felt a lot like being the teacher in Charlie Brown \u2014 all I would get is blank stares,\u201d said Elana Weinberg, the twins\u2019 Hebrew instructor. \u201cNow they answer back without even thinking too much.\u201d\n\nThere are reminders of Israel everywhere \u2014 blue-and-white flags adorn the walls of one classroom, and another class often watches an Israeli children\u2019s show. The students celebrated Israeli Independence Day this year. (In the parlance of 5- and 6-year-olds, the day was known as the country\u2019s \u201c62nd birthday,\u201d and prompted a project of construction-paper birthday cards.)\n\nThe school has not yet ventured into politically sensitive territory; nobody brought up the recent Gaza blockade. But provocative questions are certain to come as the students get older. Aalim recently asked his father, Willie Moody, to explain why the Jews and the Palestinians \u201chate each other.\u201d Mr. Moody responded: \u201cI don\u2019t even understand that. Just wait until you\u2019re older.\u201d\n\nMs. Berman said the school planned to train teachers how to deal with discussions of Israel, which she said would involve an evenhanded approach.\n\nAlthough the school cannot inquire about faith, many of the white students are Jewish. A few wear yarmulkes, and several parents acknowledged that if it were not for H.L.A., they would have sent their children to a Jewish day school, which can cost more than $20,000.\n\n\u201cFor us this was a really good alternative,\u201d said Marlyn Gaba, who has a 10-year-old son at East Midwood Hebrew Day School and a daughter at H.L.A. who also attends a religious after-school program. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare a couple of hours of religious instruction after school with the half-day he gets every day, but what I like is that she is learning the language and pride in Israel.\u201d\n\nAt the start, a few parents pulled out their children, alarmed, as Maureen Campbell, the school\u2019s principal, put it, \u201cat the diversity.\u201d But most remained.\n\nSome parents who are not Jewish said they applied because they were simply eager for their children to learn a second language. But others gave reasons the school would be unlikely to cite in its recruitment brochures.\n\n\u201cBy going to school with Jewish children, they are going to be getting a good education,\u201d said Mr. Moody. \u201cIn that community there\u2019s no foolishness when it comes to education.\u201d\n\nEven among non-Jewish parents, religion can be an attraction. Antoinette Burnett, who plans to enroll her son Rohan Nanton Jr., 4, next year, said she was envious that he would be able to understand a language she had struggled to make sense of in her church in Mill Basin.\n\n\u201cI am a child of God, and you know the Bible was originally written in Hebrew,\u201d Ms. Burnett said. \u201cWhen you understand it in Hebrew, it\u2019s a totally different meaning.

With some 1.5 billion followers and rising, Islam's influence may be growing even faster than its numbers as the Arab Spring topples long-reigning secular rulers and opens the way to religiously inspired political parties.\n\nThe case against TLC\u2019s \u201cAll-American Muslim\u201d\n\nBut while there's no doubt about the importance of Islam, experts have different theories about why Muslims appear to be more religious than members of other global faiths - and contrasting views on whether to fear the depth of Muslims' commitment to their faith.\n\nOne explanation lies in current affairs, says Azyumardi Azra, an expert on Islam in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim majority country.\n\nMany Muslims increasingly define themselves in contrast with what they see as the Christian West, says Azra, the director of the graduate school at the State Islamic University in Jakarta.\n\n\"When they confront the West that they perceive or misperceive as morally in decline, many Muslims feel that Islam is the best way of life. Islam for them is the only salvation,\" he says.\n\nThe case for TLC\u2019s \u201cAll-American Muslim\u201d\n\nThat feeling has become stronger since the September 11 attacks, as many Muslims believe there is a \"growing conflict between Islam and the so-called West,\" he says.\n\n\"Unfortunately this growing attachment to Islam among Muslims in general has been used and abused by literal-minded Muslims and the jihadists for their own purposes,\" he says.\n\nBut other experts say that deep religious commitment doesn't necessarily lead to violence.\n\n\"Being more religious doesn't necessarily mean that they will become suicide bombers,\" says Ed Husain, a former radical Islamist who is now a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nIn fact, Husain argues that religious upbringing \"could be an antidote\" to radicalism.\n\nAmerican Muslim women who cover explain their choice\n\nThe people most likely to become Islamist radicals, he says, are those who were raised without a religious education and came to Islam later, as \"born-agains.\"\n\nMuslims raised with a grounding in their religion are better able to resist the distortions of Islam peddled by recruiters to radical causes, some experts like Husain argue, making them less likely to turn to violence.\n\nBut he agrees that Muslims are strongly attached to their faith, and says the reason lies in the religion itself.\n\n\"Muslims have this mindset that we alone possess the final truth,\" Husain says.\n\nMuslims believe \"Jews and Christians went before us and Mohammed was the last prophet,\" says Husain, whose book \"The Islamist\" chronicles his experiences with radicals. \"Our prophet aimed to nullify the message of the previous prophets.\"\n\nThe depth of the Muslim commitment to Islam is not only a matter of theology and current events, but of education and history, as well, other experts say.\n\n\"Where religion is linked into the state institutions, where religion is deeply ingrained from childhood, you are getting this feeling that 'My way is the only way,'\" says Fiyaz Mughal, the director of Faith Matters, a conflict-resolution organization in London.\n\nThe Ipsos-Mori survey results included two countries with a strong link between religion and the state: Legally Muslim Saudi Arabia, which calls itself the guardian of Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina; and Indonesia, home of the world's largest Muslim population.\n\nThe third majority Muslim country in the study is Turkey, which has a very different relationship with religion. It was founded after World War I as a legally secular country. But despite generations of trying to separate mosque and state, Turkey is now governed by an Islam-inspired party, the AKP.\n\nTurkey's experience shows how difficult it can be to untangle government and religion in Muslim majority countries and helps explain the Muslim commitment to their religion, says Azyumardi Azra, the Indonesia expert.\n\nHe notes that there has been no \"Enlightenment\" in Islam as there was in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, weakening the link between church and state in many Christian countries.\n\n\"Muslim communities have never experienced intense secularization that took place in Europe and the West in general,\" says Azra. \"So Islam is still adhered to very strongly.\"\n\nBut it's not only the link between mosque and state in many Muslim majority countries that ties followers to their faith, says professor Akbar Ahmed, a former Pakistani diplomat who has written a book about Islam around the world.\n\nLike Christians who wear \"What Would Jesus Do?\" bracelets, many Muslims feel a deep personal connection to the founder of their faith, the prophet Muhammad, he says.\n\nMuhammad isn't simply a historical figure to them, but rather a personal inspiration to hundreds of millions of people around the world today.\n\n\"When a Muslim is fasting or is asked to give charity or behave in a certain way, he is constantly reminded of the example set by the prophet many centuries ago,\" argues Ahmed, the author of \"Journey Into Islam: The Crisis of Globalization.\"\n\nHis book is based on interviews with Muslims around the world, and one thing he found wherever he traveled was admiration for Muhammad.\n\n\"One of the questions was, 'Who is your role model?' From Morocco to Indonesia, it was the prophet, the prophet, the prophet,\" says Ahmed, the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University in Washington.\n\nBut while Ahmed sees similar patterns across the Islamic world, Ed Husain, the former radical, said it was important to understand its diversity, as well.\n\n\"There is no monolithic religiosity - Muslims in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are following different versions of Islam,\" says Husain. \"All we're seeing (in the survey) is an adherence to a faith.\"\n\nPolitical scientist Farid Senzai, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding in Washington, raised questions about the survey's findings.\n\n\"Look at the countries that are surveyed - Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Turkey,\" he says. \"There are about 300 million Muslims in those three countries, (who make up) about 20% of Muslims globally.\"\n\nIslam is \"incredibly important\" in Saudi Arabia, he says.\n\n\"But in Tunisia or Morocco you could have had a different result. It would have been nice if they had picked a few more Arab countries and had a bit more diversity,\" says Senzai.\n\nThe pollster, Ipsos-Mori, does monthly surveys in 24 countries, three of which are majority Muslim \u2013 Turkey, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. The other countries range from India to the United States, and Mexico to South Korea, and are the same each month, regardless of the subject the pollsters are investigating.\n\nIn the survey released in July, about six in 10 Muslims in the survey said their religion was the only way to salvation, while only a quarter of Hindus and two out of 10 Christians made that claim about their own faiths.\n\nMore than nine out of 10 Muslims said their faith was important in their lives, while the figure was 86% for Hindus and 66% for Christians.\n\nIpsos-Mori surveyed 18,473 adults via an online panel in April and released the findings in July. Results were weighted to make the results as representative as possible, but the pollster cautioned that because the survey was conducted online, it was harder to get representative results in poorer countries where internet access is not widespread.\n\nCNN polling director Keating Holland also warns that in an \"opt-in\" survey, where respondents actively choose to participate, results tend to come from \"people who are confident in their opinions and express them openly... not good for intensely private matters like faith or income or sex.\"\n\nOnline surveys in countries that are not entirely free are also open to the possibility that pollsters get \"the approved response\" in those nations, \"where the people who are most likely to be willing to talk about such matters are the ones who hold, or at least verbalize, opinions that won't get them in trouble if they are expressed,\" Holland says.\n\nThat may have been an issue in Saudi Arabia, where respondents were given the choice of not answering questions on religion due to their potential sensitivity in the kingdom. The Saudi sample was the smallest, with 354 participants, meaning \"findings for Saudi Arabia must be treated with caution,\" Ipsos-Mori said.\n\nAbout 1,000 people participated in most countries, but sample sizes were smaller in the three majority Muslim countries and in eight other countries.\n\nThe survey participants did not reflect the true percentage of Christians and Muslims in the world. Christians were over-represented \u2013 as were people who said they had no religion \u2013 and Muslims were under-represented.\n\nNearly half the respondents identified themselves as Christian. Eleven percent were Muslim, 4% were Buddhist, 3% were Hindu and 3% were \"other.\" A quarter said they had no religion and 6% refused to say.\n\nFiyaz Mughal, the interfaith expert, argues that even though the countries surveyed might not be representative of the entire Muslim world, the findings about Muslims rang broadly true. Muslims in different countries were committed to their faith for different reasons, he says.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia is an institutionally religious state. Indonesia has religion tied into its culture,\" says Mughal.\n\nBut Muslim immigrants to Europe also show strong ties to their religion, either as a defense mechanism in the face of a perceived threat, or because of an effort to cling to identity, he contends.\n\nHe detects a link between insular communities and commitment to faith regardless of what religion is involved. It is prevalent in Muslim Saudi Arabia, but he has seen it among Israeli Jews as well, he says.\n\n\"The Israeli Jewish perspective is that (the dispute with the Palestinians) is a conflict of land and religion which are integrally linked,\" Mughal says.\n\n\"What does play a role in that scenario is a sense of isolationism and seclusion in Israeli Jewish religious communities, a growing trend to say, 'Our way is the only way,'\" he says.\n\nReligious leaders of all faiths need to combat those kinds of attitudes because of the greater diversity people encounter in the world today, he argues.\n\nThey have a responsibility to teach their congregations \"that if they are following a religion, it is not as brutal or exclusive as possible,\" Mughal says. \"Things are changing. The world is a different place from what it was even 20 years ago.\"\n\nPoliticians, too, \"need to take these issues quite seriously,\" he says.\n\n\"In the Middle East there are countries - the Saudi Arabias - where you need to be saying that diversity, while it may not be a part of the country, is something they have to deal with when moving in a globalized area,\" he says.\n\nBut Senzai, the political scientist, says that it's also important for the West to take the Muslim world on its own terms.\n\n\"Many Muslims want religion to play a role in politics,\" he says. \"To assume that everyone around the world wants to be like the West - that they want liberal secular democracy - is an absurd idea.\"\n\n\u2013 CNN's Nima Elbagir and Atika Shubert contributed to this report."], "summary": ["By Richard Allen Greene, CNN (CNN) -- Every religion has its true believers and its doubters, its pious and its pragmatists, but new evidence suggests that Muslims tend to be more committed to their faith than other believers."]}, {"title": ["How Politics Has Poisoned Islam"], "text": ["ISTANBUL \u2014 We Muslims like to believe that ours is \u201ca religion of peace,\u201d but today Islam looks more like a religion of conflict and bloodshed. From the civil wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen to internal tensions in Lebanon and Bahrain, to the dangerous rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the Middle East is plagued by intra-Muslim strife that seems to go back to the ancient Sunni-Shiite rivalry.\n\nReligion is not actually at the heart of these conflicts \u2014 invariably, politics is to blame. But the misuse of Islam and its history makes these political conflicts much worse as parties, governments and militias claim that they are fighting not over power or territory but on behalf of God. And when enemies are viewed as heretics rather than just opponents, peace becomes much harder to achieve.\n\nThis conflation of religion and politics poisons Islam itself, too, by overshadowing all the religion\u2019s theological and moral teachings. The Quran\u2019s emphasis on humility and compassion is sidelined by the arrogance and aggressiveness of conflicting groups.\n\nThis is not a new problem in Islam. During the seventh-century leadership of the Prophet Muhammad, whose authority was accepted by all believers, Muslims were a united community. But soon after the prophet\u2019s death, a tension arose that escalated to bloodshed. The issue was not how to interpret the Quran or how to understand the prophet\u2019s lessons. It was about political power: Who \u2014 as the caliph, or successor to the prophet \u2014 had the right to rule?\n\nThis political question even pit the prophet\u2019s widow Aisha against his son-in-law Ali. Their followers killed one another by the thousands in the infamous Battle of the Camel in 656. The next year, they fought the even bloodier Battle of Siffin, where followers of Ali and Muawiyah, the governor of Damascus, crossed swords, deepening the divisions that became the Sunni-Shiite split that persists today.\n\nIn other words, unlike the early Christians, who were divided into sects primarily through theological disputes about the nature of Christ, early Muslims were divided into sects over political disputes about who should rule them.\n\nIt is time to undo this conflation of religion and politics. Instead of seeing this politicization of religion as natural \u2014 or even, as some Muslims do, something to be proud of \u2014 we should see it as a problem that requires a solution.\n\nThis solution should start with a paradigm shift about the very concept of the \u201ccaliphate.\u201d It\u2019s not just that the savage Islamic State has hijacked this concept for its own brutal purposes. The problem goes deeper: Traditional Muslim thought regarded the caliphate as an inherent part of Islam, unintentionally politicizing the faith for centuries. But it was not mandated by either the Quran or the prophet, but instead was a product of the historical, political experience of the Muslim community.\n\nMoreover, once Muslim thought viewed the caliphate as an integral part of the religion, political leaders and Islamic scholars built an authoritarian political tradition around it. As long as the caliph was virtuous and law-abiding, Islamic thinkers obliged Muslims to obey him. This tradition did not consider, however, that virtue was relative, power itself had a corrupting influence and even legitimate rulers could have legitimate opponents.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire, then the seat of the caliphate, took a major step forward in the Muslim political tradition by importing Western liberal norms and institutions. The sultan\u2019s powers were limited, an elected Parliament was established and political parties were allowed. This promising effort, which would make the caliph the head of a British-style democratic monarchy, was only half-successful. It ended when republican Turkey abolished the very institution of the caliphate after World War I.\n\nThe birth of the modern-day Islamist movement was a reaction to this post-caliphate vacuum. The overly politicized Islamists not only kept the traditional view that religion and state are inseparable, they even recast religion as state. \u201cTrue religion is no more than the system which God had decreed to govern the affairs of human life,\u201d Sayyid Qutb, a prominent Islamist ideologue, wrote in the 1960s. And since God would never actually come down to govern human affairs, Islamists would do it in his name.\n\nNot all Islamic thinkers took this line. The 20th-century scholar Said Nursi saw politics not as a sacred realm, but rather a devilish zone of strife. \u201cI seek refuge in God from Satan and politics,\u201d he wrote. His followers built an Islamic civil society movement in Turkey, asking only religious freedom from the state. Contemporary Muslim academics such as Abdelwahab El-Affendi and Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na\u2019im have articulated powerful Islamic arguments for embracing a liberal secularism that respects religion. They rightly point out that Muslims need secularism to be able to practice their religion as they see fit. I would add that Muslims also need secularism to save religion from serving as handmaiden to unholy wars of domination.\n\nNone of this means that Islam, with core values of justice, should be totally blind to politics. Religion can play a constructive role in political life, as when it inspires people to speak truth to power. But when Islam merges with power, or becomes a rallying cry in power struggles, its values begin to fade.\n\nMustafa Akyol is the author of \u201cIslam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty,\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter."], "summary": ["Since its earliest days, Islam has been used as a tool in power struggles.

Ron Ramsey, in his failed gubernatorial bid, suggested that the freedom of religion enshrined in the First Amendment might not apply to Muslims. \"You could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, a cult,\" the Republican candidate told an audience in Murfreesboro.\n\nDisturbingly, these assertions are often embraced by people looking to justify their intolerance. Counterclaims and evidence from religious leaders, intellectuals, government officials and others have little impact on this misperception.\n\nWhy is Islam no longer considered a religion?\n\nAmerican and European debate on Islam often revolves around the question of whether Islam is compatible with Western-style democracy and values. But because many Westerners associate Islam with al Qaeda, Palestinian militant groups and Iranian theocracy, they have a constricted, one-dimensional view of a faith that is multifaceted and complex.\n\nNo doubt, some political groups are at war with certain Muslim regimes like those in Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Pakistan, and with the West. But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. Those people who were already suspicious of Islam can justify their hostility because, instead of a religion, Islam is considered an ideology emanating from Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Turkey and the rest of the Muslim world to threaten the West.\n\nIt's worth noting that we did not seek to explain the violence and terrorism of Northern Ireland through the lens of Catholicism and Protestantism only; nobody scoured the Bible for verses about violence and war. Observers, instead, cited political, economic and historic factors to explain the conflict. By the same token, no one would argue that Gush Emunim, or Block of the Faithful, exclusively represents Judaism, or that the murder of abortion doctors represents the essence of Christianity.\n\nBut when it comes to Islam, ignoring important economic, historical and political factors has become perfectly acceptable. Politicians, pundits and ordinary Americans see Islam -- not political groups using Islamic rhetoric -- as an existential threat to Western secular norms. So, they believe, restraining it justifies extraordinary measures, even those that violate American values and the Constitution -- such as trying to ban mosques.\n\nHow did this collusion between politics and culture happen? It would be misleading to think that this perception is new. It has existed since Colonial times at least, and remains prevalent because it taps into images and memories intrinsic to the historical consciousness of Western politicians and intellectuals.\n\nScholarly literature often echoes stereotypical images of Islam and Muslims, such as women in burqas or bearded fanatics with bulging eyes shouting slogans. In some cases, headlines come directly from titles in academic journals and books: \"The Muslims Are Coming! The Muslims Are Coming!\" (Pipes, 1990), \"The Roots of Muslim Rage\" (Lewis, 1990), \"Terror, Islam, and Democracy\" (Boroumand and Boroumand, 2002), \"The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror\" (Lewis, 2003) or \"Onward Muslim Soldiers: How Jihad Still Threatens America and the West\" (Spencer, 2002).\n\nWhen Europeans were building new political principles based on the sovereignty of the people, they defined them in opposition to their most powerful political neighbor of the time: the Ottoman Empire. \"Oriental societies\" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. Islam and Muslims became the typical \"Other.\"\n\nWe seem to need to exist in opposition to an Other, and in today's national folklore, Islam plays that role. Not surprisingly, contemporary political Muslim groups across the globe play the same game, manufacturing their legitimacy as a product of opposition to their own Other, the West.\n\nIt is impossible for societies to completely rid themselves of this polarizing rhetoric. That said, societies differ in the degree to which their political imaginations are subjected to open critical discussion. It is the strength of democracy in the U.S. that such debates can exist, so demonization of the Other won't ride roughshod over reason.\n\nMuslims have a crucial role to play in these debates. Most Muslims in Europe, the United States and even in parts of the Islamic world view the presence of Islam in the West as a chance to overcome such polarization. Prohibiting mosques doesn't advance these society-saving debates, and can't reshape our imaginations so that we can one day imagine Islam and Muslims as fellow citizens.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jocelyne Cesari."], "summary": ["Opponents of an Islamic community center and mosque planned to be built near ground zero say it would desecrate hallowed ground.

The vote was a milestone in Egypt\u2019s emerging democracy after a revolution that swept away decades of authoritarian rule. But it also highlighted an issue that Egyptians will grapple with as they consolidate their democracy: the role of religion in political life.\n\nThe vote was preceded by the widespread use of religious slogans by supporters and opponents of the amendments, a debate over the place of religion in Egypt\u2019s future Constitution and a resurgence in political activity by Islamist groups. Egypt is a deeply religious society, and it is inevitable that Islam will have a place in our democratic political order. This, however, should not be a cause for alarm for Egyptians, or for the West.\n\nEgypt\u2019s religious tradition is anchored in a moderate, tolerant view of Islam. We believe that Islamic law guarantees freedom of conscience and expression (within the bounds of common decency) and equal rights for women. And as head of Egypt\u2019s agency of Islamic jurisprudence, I can assure you that the religious establishment is committed to the belief that government must be based on popular sovereignty.\n\nWhile religion cannot be completely separated from politics, we can ensure that it is not abused for political gain.\n\nMuch of the debate around the referendum focused on Article 2 of the Constitution \u2014 which, in 1971, established Islam as the religion of the state and, a few years later, the principles of Islamic law as the basis of legislation \u2014 even though the article was not up for a vote. But many religious groups feared that if the referendum failed, Egypt would eventually end up with an entirely new Constitution with no such article.\n\nOn the other side, secularists feared that Article 2, if left unchanged, could become the foundation for an Islamist state that discriminates against Coptic Christians and other religious minorities.\n\nBut acknowledgment of a nation\u2019s religious heritage is an issue of national identity, and need not interfere with the civil nature of its political processes. There is no contradiction between Article 2 and Article 7 of Egypt\u2019s interim Constitution, which guarantees equal citizenship before the law regardless of religion, race or creed. After all, Denmark, England and Norway have state churches, and Islam is the national religion of politically secular countries like Tunisia and Jordan. The rights of Egypt\u2019s Christians to absolute equality, including their right to seek election to the presidency, is sacrosanct.\n\nSimilarly, long-suppressed Islamist groups can no longer be excluded from political life. All Egyptians have the right to participate in the creation of a new Egypt, provided that they respect the basic tenets of religious freedom and the equality of all citizens. To protect our democracy, we must be vigilant against any party whose platform or political rhetoric threatens to incite sectarianism, a prohibition that is enshrined in law and in the Constitution.\n\nIslamists must understand that, in a country with such diverse movements as the Muslim Brotherhood; the Wasat party, which offers a progressive interpretation of Islam; and the conservative Salafi movements, no one group speaks for Islam.\n\nAt the same time, we should not be afraid that such groups in politics will do away with our newfound freedoms. Indeed, democracy will put Islamist movements to the test; they must now put forward programs and a political message that appeal to the Egyptian mainstream. Any drift toward radicalism will not only run contrary to the law, but will also guarantee their political marginalization.\n\nHaving overthrown the heavy hand of authoritarianism, Egyptians will not accept its return under the guise of religion. Islam will have a place in Egypt\u2019s democracy. But it will be as a pillar of freedom and tolerance, never as a means of oppression.\n\nAli Gomaa is the grand mufti of Egypt."], "summary": ["Religious groups will not restrict Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newfound freedoms, writes the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grand mufti."]}, {"title": ["Whose Reason?

However, you must than conceede to\n\nthe notion that culture and regilion are a mutually exclusive non-interdependent system of beliefs. And this \"could\" be true only under a strict analysis\n\nof specific and controled circumstances. Enviromental influences are always factors and can not be discounted in the real world. As well,\n\nenvirnomental factors of cultural are not a function of religion or religous doctrine, but the religous doctrine can be distorted by the culture. This is\n\nIslam's great issue and the one that puts it at odds with the West, be it right or wrong. The desert hostile enviroment has given birth to many more\n\npeople than it can comfortable support and this creates a cultural of violence and hostile envy that is separate from religion and specific to\n\nenvironmental factors. This cultural feeling is then interperated by the relgious machine and a new system of thinking is spawned. Islam and Arab\n\ndesert cultural has saddly spawned of vicious culutre of revenage and deadly envy. When was the last time a black American blow up a group of\n\nwhites as a payback for salvery? The enviroment does not support this thought pattern therefor it has not happened.\n\nThe logical deduction is that the term \"Musilm\" represents of those of a particular religious faith and not necessarily their cultural beliefs is both true\n\nand false. It is this matter of cultural beliefs which are at the crux of the issue that divides the West and the Middle East in terms of identity and\n\nIslam and the religion on paper is not where the problem lies, the culture and its contextual subtext is where the issue lies as it always does in human\n\npyschology.

There few resources in the desert which makes\n\npeople like their surroundings, consistently harsh and unchanging. While coming the defense of Islam as a religion is acceptable discounting the real cultural basis for the thought process of desert arab peopples is not. Their specific lack of environmental resources has yeilded them their thought process and cultural belif system that is mutally exclusive of religion as it appears on paper.\n\nPosted November 29, 2006 3:43 PM"], "summary": ["A conversation on religion with Jon Meacham, Sally Quinn and Sherman Jackson.

Four panelists, two for and two against, presented arguments on the motion of \"Islam Is a Religion of Peace.\" About 800 showed up to learn the answer.\n\nProblem is, there is no one answer.\n\nThe Muslim community is by no means monolithic and viewing us as one is problematic. We are diverse.\n\nYet we find ourselves in a moment in which we are very narrowly understood. That normative understanding is equated to something radical, despite the fact that 93 percent of Muslims are found to be far from radical according to recent Gallup surveys.\n\nWhat becomes more problematic is that typically when one of us from that 93 percent steps up to speak, we are vehemently told that we either do not represent Islam or even more absurdly that we are not truly practicing Islam's teachings.\n\nZeba Khan, a panelist for the \"Islam Is a Religion of Peace\" last week, was met with such a response. She started off the debate by sharing her personal story about growing up in Ohio, attending a Hebrew Day School, and being raised by Indian parents in a Muslim household. \"Just because you may not hear us,\" said Khan,\" doesn't mean we are not speaking.\"\n\nAyaan Hirsi Ali , speaking against the motion, followed Zeba and immediately said, \"The problem with Islam is who speaks for Islam.\" She went on to say, \"I concede (the radical voice) is a minority,\" and expressed her desire that someone like Zeba Khan actually would speak for Islam, but, in her opinion, could not and does not.\n\nAnd so Zeba's voice, her interpretation, and all of her efforts were collectively dismissed since she did not fit into what Hirsi Ali believed Islam to be.\n\nMaajid Nawaz, Zeba Khan's co-panelist for the motion, was dismissed just as easily. \"This debate is not about making excuses for terrorism,\" he said. \"This debate acknowledges that Muslims bear a responsibility in reclaiming their faith from a minority.\"\n\nIf anyone understands the issues of that minority voice it is Nawaz. Having been a member of the political party Hizb ut-Tahrir for 14 years, Nawaz was a founding member in Denmark and Pakistan. In his own words, he eventually served a sentence for four years in an Egyptian prison as an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience, and during them that time broke away from Hizb ut-Tahrir's ideology.\n\nHe has since dedicated his life to counter-radicalism initiatives and seeks to uphold the responsibility that he spoke of through his work. He even uniquely acknowledges the presence of a radical element in Islam and how its misinterpretation is still in fact an interpretation that needs to be dealt with.\n\nDespite this, those opposed to the motion told him that it is his peaceful understanding of Islam that is rooted in misinterpretation, since it does not match up with the interpretation put forth by the radical minority, and thus somehow ignores the fundamentals of Islam since those groups somehow are the end-all be-all of what Islam actually means.\n\nThat a peaceful interpretation of the religion, or even one that is non-radical, can only exist by ignoring fundamental texts is flawed in its logic.\n\nCharacteristic of any text - whether religious or not - is its ability to be interpreted through the lens of its reader. Interpretations of the Quran that espouse ideas of tolerance, compassion and mercy have existed and continue to exist in the majority of Muslim communities since the advent of Islam 1400 years ago.\n\nAs much as Muslims need to acknowledge the existence of a minority voice that is radicalized, so too does a broader society need to acknowledge the existence of a majority voice that is not radicalized and more importantly condemns radical thought. There are those who make Islam to be something restrictive and radical, but there are many, many more who do not.\n\nModerating the panel last week, ABC News correspondent John Donvan said speaking to those against the motion, \"You are making it sound like Islam is what you make it to be. Why then can it not be the peaceful Islam that we see being practiced by so many around the world?\"\n\nThe answer, Mr. Donvan, is that it can be, and for the majority of us, it is.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Khalid Latif\n\nEditor's Note #2: Bloomberg TV will be airing parts of the debate tonight at 9pm Eastern.

By Khalid Latif, Special to CNN Last week, New York University hosted the Intelligence Squared Debates at its Skirball Center for the Performing Arts."]}, {"title": ["'Jihad Jane' gets 10-year sentence for terror plot against cartoonist"], "text": ["The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. Muslims who do not join the fight are called 'hypocrites' and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.\n\nUnlike nearly all of the Old Testament verses of violence, the verses of violence in the Quran are mostly open-ended, meaning that they are not restrained by the historical context of the surrounding text. They are part of the eternal, unchanging word of Allah, and just as relevant or subjective as anything else in the Quran.\n\nThe context of violent passages is more ambiguous than might be expected of a perfect book from a loving God, however this can work both ways. Most of today's Muslims exercise a personal choice to interpret their holy book's call to arms according to their own moral preconceptions about justifiable violence. Apologists cater to their preferences with tenuous arguments that gloss over historical fact and generally do not stand up to scrutiny. Still, it is important to note that the problem is not bad people, but bad ideology.\n\nUnfortunately, there are very few verses of tolerance and peace to abrogate or even balance out the many that call for nonbelievers to be fought and subdued until they either accept humiliation, convert to Islam, or are killed. Muhammad's own martial legacy - and that of his companions - along with the remarkable stress on violence found in the Quran have produced a trail of blood and tears across world history.\n\nOther than the fact that Muslims haven't killed every non-Muslim under their domain, there is very little else that they can point to as proof that theirs is a peaceful, tolerant religion. Where Islam is dominant (as in the Middle East and Pakistan) religious minorities suffer brutal persecution with little resistance. Where Islam is in the minority (as in Thailand, the Philippines and Europe) there is the threat of violence if Muslim demands are not met. Either situation seems to provide a justification for religious terrorism, which is persistent and endemic to Islamic fundamentalism.\n\nThe reasons are obvious and begin with the Quran. Few verses of Islam's most sacred text can be construed to fit the contemporary virtues of religious tolerance and universal brotherhood. Those that do are earlier \"Meccan\" verses which are obviously abrogated by later ones. This is why Muslim apologists speak of the \"risks\" of trying to interpret the Quran without their \"assistance\" - even while claiming that it is a perfect book.\n\nFar from being mere history or theological construct, the violent verses of the Quran have played a key role in very real massacre and genocide. This includes the brutal slaughter of tens of millions of Hindus for five centuries beginning around 1000 AD with Mahmud of Ghazni's bloody conquest. Both he and the later Tamerlane (Islam's Genghis Khan) slaughtered an untold number merely for defending their temples from destruction. Buddhism was very nearly wiped off the Indian subcontinent. Judaism and Christianity met the same fate (albeit more slowly) in areas conquered by Muslim armies, including the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe, including today's Turkey. Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of a proud Persian people is despised by Muslims and barely survives in modern Iran.\n\nSo ingrained is violence in the religion that Islam has never really stopped being at war, either with other religions or with itself.\n\nMuhammad was a military leader, laying siege to towns, massacring the men, raping their women, enslaving their children, and taking the property of others as his own. On several occasions he rejected offers of surrender from the besieged inhabitants and even butchered captives. He actually inspired his followers to battle when they did not feel it was right to fight, promising them slaves and booty if they did and threatening them with Hell if they did not. Muhammad allowed his men to rape traumatized women captured in battle, usually on the very day their husbands and family members were slaughtered.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that, for the most part, Muslim armies waged aggressive campaigns, and the religion's most dramatic military conquests were made by the actual companions of Muhammad in the decades following his death. The early Islamic principle of warfare was that the civilian population of a town was to be destroyed (ie. men executed, women and children taken as slaves) if they defended themselves. Although modern apologists often claim that Muslims are only supposed to attack in self-defense, this is an oxymoron that is flatly contradicted by the accounts of Islamic historians and others that go back to the time of Muhammad.\n\nConsider the example of the Qurayza Jews, who were completely obliterated only five years after Muhammad arrived in Medina. Their leader opted to stay neutral when their town was besieged by a Meccan army that was sent to take revenge for Muhammad's deadly caravan raids. The tribe killed no one from either side and even surrendered peacefully to Muhammad after the Meccans had been turned back. Yet the prophet of Islam had every male member of the Qurayza beheaded, and every woman and child enslaved, even raping one of the captives himself (what Muslim apologists might refer to as \"same day marriage\").\n\nOne of Islam's most revered modern scholars, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, openly sanctions offensive Jihad: \"In the Jihad which you are seeking, you look for the enemy and invade him. This type of Jihad takes place only when the Islamic state is invading other [countries] in order to spread the word of Islam and to remove obstacles standing in its way.\" Elsewhere, he notes: \"Islam has the right to take the initiative\u2026this is God\u2019s religion and it is for the whole world. It has the right to destroy all obstacles in the form of institutions and traditions \u2026 it attacks institutions and traditions to release human beings from their poisonous influences, which distort human nature and curtail human freedom. Those who say that Islamic Jihad was merely for the defense of the 'homeland of Islam' diminish the greatness of the Islamic way of life.\"\n\nThe widely respected Dictionary of Islam defines Jihad as \"A religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of Muhammad. It is an incumbent religious duty, established in the Qur'an and in the Traditions as a divine institution, and enjoined specially for the purpose of advancing Islam and of repelling evil from Muslims\u2026[Quoting from the Hanafi school, Hedaya, 2:140, 141.], \"The destruction of the sword is incurred by infidels, although they be not the first aggressors, as appears from various passages in the traditions which are generally received to this effect.\"\n\nMuhammad's failure to leave a clear line of succession resulted in perpetual internal war following his death. Those who knew him best first fought to keep remote tribes from leaving Islam and reverting to their preferred religion (the Ridda or 'Apostasy wars'). Then, within the closer community, early Meccan converts battled later ones. Hostility developed between those immigrants who had traveled with Muhammad to Mecca and the Ansar at Medina who had helped them settle in. Finally there was a violent struggle within Muhammad's own family between his favorite wife and favorite daughter - a jagged schism that has left Shias and Sunnis at each others' throats to this day.\n\nThe strangest and most untrue thing that can be said about Islam is that it is a Religion of Peace. If every standard by which the West is judged and condemned (slavery, imperialism, intolerance, misogyny, sexual repression, warfare...) were applied equally to Islam, the verdict would be devastating. Islam never gives up what it conquers, be it religion, culture, language or life. Neither does it make apologies or any real effort at moral progress. It is the least open to dialogue and the most self-absorbed. It is convinced of its own perfection, yet brutally shuns self-examination and represses criticism.\n\nThis is what makes the Quran's verses of violence so dangerous. They are given the weight of divine command. While Muslim terrorists take them as literally as anything else in their holy book, and understand that Islam is incomplete without Jihad, moderates offer little to contradict them - outside of opinion. Indeed, what do they have? Speaking of peace and love may win over the ignorant, but when every twelfth verse of Islam's holiest book either speaks to Allah's hatred for non-Muslims or calls for their death, forced conversion, or subjugation, it's little wonder that sympathy for terrorism runs as deeply as it does in the broader community - even if most Muslims personally prefer not to interpret their religion in this way.\n\nAlthough scholars like Ibn Khaldun, one of Islam's most respected philosophers, understood that \"the holy war is a religious duty, because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and (the obligation to) convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force\", many other Muslims are either unaware or willfully ignorant of the Quran's near absence of verses that preach universal non-violence. Their understanding of Islam comes from what they are taught by others. In the West, it is typical for believers to think that their religion must be like Christianity - preaching the New Testament virtues of peace, love, and tolerance - because Muslims are taught that Islam is supposed to be superior in every way. They are somewhat surprised and embarrassed to learn that the evidence of the Quran and the bloody history of Islam are very much in contradiction to this.\n\nOthers simply accept the violence. In 1991, a Palestinian couple in America was convicted of stabbing their daughter to death for being too Westernized. A family friend came to their defense, excoriating the jury for not understanding the \"culture\", claiming that the father was merely following \"the religion\" and saying that the couple had to \"discipline their daughter or lose respect.\" (source). In 2011, unrepentant Palestinian terrorists, responsible for the brutal murders of civilians, women and children explicitly in the name of Allah were treated to a luxurious \"holy pilgrimage\" to Mecca by the Saudi king - without a single Muslim voice raised in protest.\n\nFor their part, Western liberals would do well not to sacrifice critical thinking to the god of political correctness, or look for reasons to bring other religion down to the level of Islam merely to avoid the existential truth that this it is both different and dangerous.\n\nThere are just too many Muslims who take the Quran literally... and too many others who couldn't care less about the violence done in the name of Islam."], "summary": ["A Pennsylvania woman known as \u201cJihad Jane\u201d who became a follower of radical Islam and sought to kill a Swedish cartoonist was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison.
