Al, charging the grandstanding civil rights leader with muscling companies like Sony Pictures out of \u201chush money\u201d for his National Action Network, in order to make racial discrimination accusations go away.\n\nBut according to Sharpton, the Post article somehow forgot to mention that their 83-year-old Svengali has played ball with him, too.\n\nIn February 2009, when Sharpton was leading protests outside the Post\u2019s Midtown headquarters after it ran a cartoon that many New Yorkers felt compared President Obama to a chimpanzee, Sharpton says he met with the Post\u2019s parent, News Corp., to hammer out a deal.\n\n\u201cI met with Murdoch, he issued a statement, and we let it go,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cAfter that they formed this diversity board where we were supposed to have input, then the board fell apart.\u201d\n\nSharpton insists he wasn\u2019t paid for his consultancy on that board, but he estimates it was \u201cfour or five years ago,\u201d right around 2009, that News Corp. started buying $5,000 to $10,000 tables at his NAN events. He also denies a connection between those transactions and the end of his protests, arguing that News Corp.\u2019s contributions to his organization date back to around 2007.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about a company wanting to attend your banquet and mingle, they might buy a table or a ticket,\u201d Sharpton told Confidenti@l. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s \u2018a shakedown.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSharpton insists that just like any other company, News Corp., the parent company of the Post and Fox News, pays to attend NAN events and network with prominent black businessman and politicians including Obama.\n\nSharpton also points out that around 2009, Fox commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly donated $25,000 to his organization and that it hasn\u2019t bought O\u2019Reilly amnesty from criticism.\n\nIn their Sunday takedown, the Post further contends, \u201cFor more than a decade, corporations have shelled out thousands of dollars in donations and consulting fees to Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network. What they get in return is the reverend\u2019s supposed sway in the black community or, more often, his silence.\u201d\n\nThe Post story also quoted an anonymous \u201csource who has worked with the Harlem preacher\u201d as saying, \u201cOnce Sharpton\u2019s on board, he plays the race card all the way through. He just keeps asking for more and more money.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sharpton, who makes $241,000 a year as the head of NAN, Murdoch and the Post have taken aim at him because his anti-police brutality rhetoric conflicts with their conservative agenda.\n\n\u201cThey are relating to the police fervor and want to get me out of the equation,\u201d he says.\n\nNews Corp. declined to respond to multiple requests for comment."], "summary": ["Al Sharpton says the New York Post should know better than to accuse him of political pay-to-play."]}, {"title": ["Eric Garner protest march moved amid new calls for independent investigation"], "text": ["A New York City group protesting about the death of Eric Garner, who died after a New York police officer put him in a chokehold while attempting to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, dropped plans for a march across the Verrazano-Narrows bridge, which connects Staten Island with Brooklyn, something local politicians had said would cause traffic havoc.\n\nThe announcement of the change to the protest on Saturday 23 August comes among growing calls for an independent investigation into Garner\u2019s death, which a medical examiner ruled a homicide after an autopsy. A video of the encounter that led to the death of Garner recorded by a bystander shows Garner, who had asthma, gasping, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Chokeholds are banned by NYPD policy.\n\nThe group organising the demonstration, National Action Network (NAN), is led by Reverend Al Sharpton. Sharpton has spoken with members of Garner\u2019s family several times since Garner\u2019s death, and called for the march across the Verrazano-Narrows. Now, instead of crossing the bridge, NAN will gather in Staten Island on Saturday and march to the 120th police precinct.\n\nThe alteration to the march plan was made public one day after six members of New York\u2019s congressional delegation called on the Department of Justice to launch an investigation into Garner\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cEric Garner is dead. The person who videotaped the incident was arrested. And the officer who killed Mr Garner in broad daylight remains free and on the NYPD\u2019s payroll. There\u2019s something wrong with that picture,\u201d said Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn in the US House of Representatives. \u201cInstead of focusing on broken windows, we should focus on the broken portrait of justice in New York City.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to the department, Jeffries and his five colleagues wrote, \u201cThere is no indication that the local district attorney is prepared to aggressively prosecute this case. Absent DOJ intervention, we may be marching toward a miscarriage of justice.\n\n\u201cMr Garner\u2019s death has taken place in the context of a broken windows policing strategy that appears to target communities of color for the enforcement of minor violations and low-level criminal offences,\u201d the letter said. \u201cConversely, there is reason to believe that similar activity is ignored by the NYPD in the majority-white neighbourhoods of New York City.\u201d\n\nSince Garner\u2019s death, videos showing police use of force in minority neighbourhoods in New York have been widely circulated and picked up by the media.\n\nOne week after the video of Garner grabbed national media attention, a bystander captured an officer using the same banned chokehold during a Harlem subway station arrest. A week after that, NYPD officers were filmed dragging a Brooklyn grandmother from her apartment in only her underwear. Another video showed police beating a suspect pinned to the ground in the Inwood neighbourhood. One officer was placed on modified duty after he was recorded pulling a gun on a man in the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant who was pinned to the ground.

Such a charge is brought in a case in which a victim is \u201cincapable of consent,\u201d suggesting that the woman may have been intoxicated or passed out during the alleged encounter.\n\nReached on Saturday night, Rubenstein, 70, declined to comment. He has not been charged.\n\n\u201cSanford Rubenstein vehemently denies any misconduct,\u201d said his lawyer, Michael Ross.\n\nThe alleged victim could not be reached.\n\nIn a statement, Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, or NAN, sought to distance itself from the allegation.\n\n\u201cThe allegations as reported occurred at a private residence after a NAN event and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev. Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time,\u201d the statement read.\n\nAmong the bold-faced names at Sharpton\u2019s soir\u00e9e were Mayor de Blasio, Gov. Cuomo, director Spike Lee and legendary singer Aretha Franklin.\n\nThat Rubenstein attended the bash was no surprise; he and Sharpton have been buddy-buddy for nearly 20 years.\n\nTheir alliance was formed in 1997 when Rubenstein was handling the civil case for Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant who was sodomized with a broom handle by a gang of cops inside a Brooklyn precinct house.\n\nRubenstein, in a self-published 2010 memoir, described how he became Sharpton\u2019s go-to legal eagle. When one of Rubenstein\u2019s associates suggested Sharpton be invited to a rally for Louima, Rubenstein initially balked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never met Sharpton; all I really knew about him was what I\u2019d learned from the media, which had generally portrayed him as a controversial figure \u2014 maybe too controversial, to my thinking,\u201d Rubenstein wrote in the memoir, titled \u201cThe Outrageous Rubenstein.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe involvement of Sharpton and his civil rights organization, the National Action Network, ended up benefiting the march and the cause of obtaining justice for Louima immensely.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I would go on to become both Sharpton\u2019s friend and his personal lawyer.\u201d\n\nSince then, Rubenstein has lived in the media spotlight as one of the city\u2019s most high-profile attorneys.\n\nKnown for his dapper suits and frequent press conferences, Rubenstein has been front and center in many of the city\u2019s most shocking police brutality cases.\n\nThe Louima case was settled in July 2001 for a stunning $7.1 million, the largest police brutality payout in city history at the time.\n\nThe Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association paid Louima an additional $1.6 million as part of the settlement.\n\nWith Sharpton\u2019s backing, Rubenstein also represented the family of Sean Bell, a 23-year-old man who died in a hail of police bullets outside a Queens club on the morning of the day he was to be married in 2006.\n\nThat case, settled in 2010, resulted in a $7.15 million payout to Bell\u2019s estate and two other victims.\n\nIt came as no surprise when Rubenstein was tapped to represent the family of Eric Garner, the 43-year-old Staten Island man who died in July after a police officer put him into an apparent chokehold while he was being arrested for selling loose cigarettes.\n\nRubenstein is a regular presence at National Action Network\u2019s Harlem headquarters.\n\nIn fact, Sharpton has been known to refer to the legal ace as \u201cBrother Rubenstein.\u201d\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, he was raised in a Long Island City housing project.\n\n\u201cFrom the projects to the penthouse,\u201d Rubenstein has said in describing the arc of his life.\n\nA graduate of Brooklyn Law School, he was admitted to the city bar in 1972, records show.\n\nRubenstein is now a fixture on cable news, appearing as a legal analyst on CNN, Fox and MSNBC.\n\nIn his online bio, the famed attorney says he\u2019s best known for \u201cthe trial before the trial in the court of public opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore a lawyer steps into a courtroom when representing a victim in a high-profile case, there is a trial in the media that shapes public opinion on behalf of one side or the other,\u201d Rubenstein is quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cMy job and responsibility is to get my client\u2019s view of the facts out before the public as to offset or preempt any negative material being put out by the other side.\u201d\n\nIn New York, rape in the third degree is a class E felony. It is punishable by one to four years in prison.

It was the largest police brutality payout in city history at the time.\n\nIn 2006 the unarmed 23-year-old was killed in a hail of 50 police bullets fired outside of a Queens strip club early on the morning of his wedding. The city agreed to pay $3.25 million to Bell\u2019s estate, $3 million to victim Joseph Guzman and $900,000 to victim Trent Benefield.\n\nIn 2012, the 35-year-old Brooklyn woman\u2019s hands and feet had to be amputated after a hospital sent her home with a diagnosis of kidney stones and FDNY medics refused to take her back to the emergency room the following day.

And whatever Mum and Nan Wicks say, goes.\n\n\u201cThey are the bosses,\u201d Pete proudly admits.\n\nHe\u2019s now added a third special lady to his list, in the form of co-star and girlfriend Megan McKenna.\n\nAfter making their relationship official in April, they\u2019ve cemented themselves as the hottest reality couple around.\n\nDespite frequently finding themselves miles apart due to their hectic schedules \u2014 Megan, 23, jetted off to Miami in April for work, while Pete had a lads\u2019 holiday in Mexico with his pal James Lock \u2014 they\u2019ve still managed to make things work.\n\nBut although he\u2019s been happily documenting their romance through daily Snapchat selfies, Pete initially seems a little reluctant to speak candidly about their relationship.\n\n\u201cIs this interview going to be all about Megan?\u201d he asks nervously.\n\nFortunately, he\u2019s clearly head over heels and he soon relaxes enough to open up about his other half, as well as revealing how far his body ink addiction goes and why Megan has to play second fiddle to his beloved pet dogs at bedtime\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re all loved-up with Megan. How is the relationship going? It\u2019s great. We clicked straight away as we\u2019re quite similar in lots of ways and how we think about things.\n\nWe\u2019re both quite opinionated and fiery, but I tend to be more reserved when it comes to my opinions.\n\nMegan\u2019s got this stigma that she\u2019s a bit nutty, but a lot of the time when she loses her temper, she\u2019s actually right.\n\nShe just expresses herself in a way that people either love or hate.\n\nDoes Megan\u2019s fiery side mean you have lots of rows?\n\nWe don\u2019t row that much. There\u2019s no need to be fiery if you\u2019ve been treated well.\n\nI\u2019m not experienced in relationships \u2014 I\u2019ve only had one other, which lasted eight months \u2014 but I think being a good boyfriend comes down to treating your missus with respect. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s used to being treated the way I treat her.\n\nWould you say that you\u2019re a loyal boyfriend?\n\nWhen you\u2019re in a relationship, I don\u2019t see the point of going elsewhere. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve not been in many relationships before now.\n\nIf someone grabs your attention, it doesn\u2019t matter how many people want you, it\u2019s about who you want.\n\nLoyalty is the biggest thing for me and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got it tattooed on the back of my neck.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t got trust, you haven\u2019t got anything.\n\nDo you ever worry about the Towie curse wrecking your relationship?\n\nA lot of the time on reality shows, people get together just because they work together.\n\nMegan and I are different because we get along and it was a natural thing.\n\nRegardless of what\u2019s happened with other people\u2019s relationships on the show, they\u2019re not the same as mine.\n\nAre there certain things that are off-limits for you to show on TV? It\u2019s kind of hypocritical for me to say, as I\u2019m appearing on a reality show, but a private life is a happy life.\n\nThere are certain things that you don\u2019t need to share with the entire world, like anything to do with our sex life or emotions.\n\nYou\u2019ve both been jetting away to different countries for work recently. Do you keep the passion alive by sending sexy selfies to each other?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a good imagination, you don\u2019t need a visual aid. There are different ways to keep the passion alive without sending pictures, but that\u2019s between me and her.\n\nWould you say you\u2019re quite vain?\n\nNot really, I think people just assume that I am because I\u2019m from Essex.\n\nThough, obviously, I have weekly sunbeds. I also shave and I wash my hair once a week.\n\nI\u2019m tempted to get rid of my long hair because it\u2019s a lot of work.\n\nYou\u2019ve got an impressive collection of tattoos. How many do you have now? I think I\u2019ve got a bit of a problem because I don\u2019t reckon I\u2019ve got that many! I\u2019ve got quite an addictive personality.\n\nBecause a lot of my tattoos on the top half of my body join up, I say I have one big one.\n\nI\u2019ve just started my leg tattoo and I\u2019ve still got my bum cheeks free, so I\u2019m going to be getting more \u2014 I\u2019m starting to run out of space!\n\nDo you plan on fully covering your body in tatts?\n\nI\u2019m going to leave some parts free. My mum hates tattoos, so I get told off.\n\nShe used to get quite upset about it, but now she\u2019s given up.\n\nI don\u2019t think she expected her son to turn out with hair down to his armpits and tattoos everywhere.\n\nFortunately, she\u2019s stuck with me.\n\nWould you ever consider getting a tattoo of a girlfriend\u2019s name?\n\nNo, but it\u2019s not a commitment thing. I\u2019ll probably get my wife\u2019s name, as when you get married it\u2019s for the rest of your life.\n\nI would also get my kids\u2019 names, as they won\u2019t be going anywhere.\n\nDo you have a favourite tattoo?\n\nThe one of my mum and nan\u2019s names, as they\u2019re the most important people to me. I\u2019m really close with them.\n\nI\u2019ve also got Lost Soul tattooed on my knuckles, which is what my nan calls me.\n\nIt\u2019s very cute that you\u2019re so close to them\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s no one I admire more than my mum for what she\u2019s done in my life.\n\nMy nan is my best friend and I speak to her about everything. She is my go-to person and tells me the truth regardless.\n\nThey\u2019re probably the reason why I am the way I am, in terms of the way I treat Megan.\n\nDespite your hard exterior, are you just a big softie?\n\nYes, I prefer animals to people because they\u2019re more loyal. If you treat them well, they don\u2019t judge you.\n\nI have a pair of rescue French bulldogs called Eric and Ernest. I talk to them like they\u2019re my kids \u2014 it\u2019s embarrassing!\n\nThey also sleep in bed with me. The only opinions that matter to me are my nan\u2019s and my dogs\u2019.\n\nSo is not getting on with your nan and your dogs a deal-breaker?\n\nYeah. Fortunately Megan has done very well with both my nan and the dogs!\n\nThe dogs get priority in the bed though, as they are my children. But we\u2019re very good at sharing, so it\u2019s fine."], "summary": ["WITH his mahogany tan, super-styled hair\u00a0and confident swagger, Pete Wicks is every inch an Essex man \u2014 all 5ft 10in of him.

He died in a hospital in the early hours of Friday, bringing to five the death toll from four nights of rioting.\n\nPhotos: Four nights of riots\n\nAcross northern England in Manchester, Salford and Liverpool, police have arrested over 200 so far, and in Birmingham in central England, West Midlands police say arrests total 467.\n\nCourts in London have been working day and night to process a stream of riot-linked arrests, most involving charges of burglary, theft and arson, with some murder charges.\n\nSentences are swiftly carried out or cases referred to youth courts in the case of minors, and magistrates' courts pass on some serious cases to higher courts with tougher sentencing power.\n\nCourts are flooded with a huge variety of suspects -- from hooded youths with previous convictions to middle-class students, young professionals, adult working people and teenagers and children, some as young as 11 and 12. Often they are brought in by family members.\n\nMost defendants are denied bail, or let go with a fine, but sentences are swift and mostly tough -- one boy caught with a case of bottled water looted from a supermarket was given a six-month jail sentence.\n\nMany of those allowed out on bail left courts surrounded by TV cameras, covering their heads. Others were openly defiant and hurled abuse at the press crowds.\n\nPoliticians are busy looking for social remedies to the violence, with Prime Minister David Cameron reported to be looking to former Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton for advice on gang culture as he told Parliament in his Thursday address.\n\nIn a statement from his office later Thursday, Bratton said he would be honored to help.\n\nOn Friday morning, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg was visiting a small police station in the northern county of Nottingham that had been firebombed Tuesday. Opposition leader Ed Miliband toured Brixton, ravaged by violence on Monday night .\n\nPolice were quick to answer Cameron's statement Thursday in which he spoke of their being taken unaware and unprepared for Saturday night's violence.\n\nHugh Orde, a senior police officer and a former police chief of Northern Ireland's police force, said, \"This was a new set of circumstances?. The tactics decided by chief officers and their staff ? and the robust policing tactics we chose to adopt, delivered,\" he said in a BBC interview. He angrily dismissed suggestions that it took politicians returning from vacation to give the police the necessary powers.\n\n\"The fact that politicians chose to come back [from holiday] is an irrelevance in terms of the tactics that were by then developing,\" he said. It was not in Home Secretary Theresa May's power to cancel police leave, he said.\n\nPhotos: Four nights of riots"], "summary": ["British police and law courts working round the clock continue rounding up rioters that laid waste to homes and businesses throughout the country this week.

I left there and shot off to the dog track.\n\nWhen I called round to Sandra's the next evening, her dad \u0097 a great big geezer and a foreman in the docks \u0097 began to quiz me.\n\n\"Where did you go last night when you left here?\" he barked.\n\n\"Hang about,\" I said. \"What business is it of yours?\"\n\n\"You went to the dogs,\" he said, glaring at me. It turned out he and Sandra's brother had followed me in their van when I left, all the way to the dog track.\n\n1968 ... playing for West Ham\n\n\"You're supposed to be saving up to buy a house,\" her dad said. \"I don't want you messing around with my daughter if you're going to waste your money gambling.\"\n\nGambling had been the downfall of Sandra's grandad \u0096 and her mum, who had felt the effects of that addiction, wanted to make sure her daughter was kept well away from it.\n\nBut it was equally inevitable that gambling would be in my blood given the influence of my nan Maggie Brown, my mum's mother.\n\nWhat a character she was. I used to rush home from school every day to my nan's for dinner and the first thing she did was put the newspaper in front of me and ask me to pick out three horses.\n\n1968 ... with nan Maggie Brown on wedding day\n\nI couldn't read or write, but she'd put a pen in my hand and ask me to mark three selections.\n\nThen she'd pick up the paper, rub it on my head \u0097 \"Ginger for luck,\" she'd say \u0097 and wait for Cyril the paperboy, also known as Cyril the bookie, to come round.\n\nMy nan was a bookie's runner. She'd go round the whole street collecting bets and then pass them on to Cyril.\n\nThe people in the neighbourhood would write their bets on little bits of paper and put their names on the bottom.\n\nThat was how they'd bet. Three tuppenny doubles and a tuppenny treble.\n\nMy nan would have them all on the mantelpiece, and when Cyril came round with the paper, she'd have the bets wrapped up individually and drop them in Cyril's satchel.\n\nHis paper round was just a front for his bookmaking because being a bookie was illegal in those days, as was being a bookie's runner.\n\n1980s ... with Sandra at home in Bournemouth\n\nI'd come home from school for dinner and quite often my nan would be getting carted away in a police car.\n\n\"Your dinner's in the oven,\" she'd shout to me. \"These bastards won't keep me for long. I'll be home in an hour, boy.\"\n\nThe police would have her down the station for a couple of hours, warn her off then she'd come back and do exactly the same as before.\n\nThey never put her off. She loved it. But somehow her gambling instincts were never picked up by my mum.\n\nShe's not a gambler, although she will have a bet on the Derby.\n\nMy dad, Harry Senior, was never a punter. He just lived for football.\n\nHe was a docker and my mum worked in the Co-op.\n\nI was an only child, which I suppose was unusual for those days, and one of my most vivid memories from my childhood was following him all over the place to watch him play football.\n\n2002 ... with his father, Harry Snr\n\nHe was terrific. I know lots of people say they could have made it as a professional, but he had terrific ability.\n\nHe only played in the local Business Houses League, but he was far, far better than that. I remember one year in the late Seventies we spent a weekend in a caravan in the Isle of Sheppey.\n\nFrank Lampard Snr had just been picked for England, but in a kickabout we had he couldn't get the ball off my dad, who must have been about 55 at the time.\n\nHe would nutmeg him, dragging the ball and Frank one way then the other. He ran Frank silly.\n\nMy dad died in 2006, aged 82, but he had a rough life as a kid.\n\nHis mum and dad died when he was about 15 and he was in the Army a year later. He was a PoW during the Second World War and I think by the time it ended he'd perhaps missed his chance to make a name for himself in football.\n\n2008 ... Soccer Aid training session\n\nAll the top amateur teams in London kept asking him to play for them, but he was happy playing with his mates.\n\nFunnily enough betting also helped me in my early years at West Ham in the Sixties, when the dressing room was full of gamblers.\n\nBudgie Byrne and Alan Sealey were probably the biggest. It was a ritual the evening before a Saturday match to spend the night at the dogs.\n\nIf it was Newcastle we'd go to Gosforth Park, if it was Manchester United or City we'd go to Salford. That's how it was.\n\nOn the team coach the cards were always out. If we weren't playing we were gambling.\n\nThat's the environment I joined when I first went to West Ham and in truth it helped me tremendously.\n\n2011 ... at Old Trafford with Fergie\n\nI was a lot younger than the established players but they all liked me because I would join in their card games or their dog nights. I was one of the lads.\n\nGambling helped me become accepted far more quickly than I could ever have hoped.\n\nBut I was never a serious gambler and I'm still not.\n\nLIKE me, Sir Alex Ferguson loves a bet, and like me he had an account with a firm called Surrey Racing, who invite us to their box at Kempton every year.\n\nI remember one occasion when I rang up to place a bet and just before I put the phone down the telephonist said: \"Thank you very much Mr Ferguson.\"\n\nI'd given her my account number, which is only one digit different from Fergie's, and she had clearly chalked up the bet to the wrong account.\n\nNow this was something like a game of Scruples. If the bet lost I could just keep quiet and Fergie would end up paying for it. If it won I could phone up and tell Surrey they'd made a mistake and I'd get my dough.\n\nI'm ashamed to admit I chickened out and pointed out the error straight away.

Set in Victorian England during the 1890s , it tells a coming of age story about a young woman named Nan who falls in love with a male impersonator , follows her to London , and finds various ways to support herself as she journeys through the city . The picaresque plot elements have prompted scholars and reviewers to compare it to similar British urban adventure stories written by Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe . The novel has pervasive lesbian themes , concentrating on eroticism and self @-@ discovery . Waters was working on a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would like to read . Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London , she consciously chose an urban setting . As opposed to previous lesbian @-@ themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it , Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings . She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded . The main character 's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender , sexism , and class difference . As Waters ' debut novel , Tipping the Velvet was highly acclaimed and was chosen by The New York Times and The Library Journal as one of the best books of 1998 . Waters followed it with two other novels set in the Victorian era , both of which were also well received . Reviewers have offered the most praise for Tipping the Velvet 's use of humour , adventure , and sexual explicitness . The novel was adapted into a somewhat controversial three @-@ part series of the same name produced and broadcast by the BBC in 2002 and a stage play in 2015 . When Sarah Waters was 19 years old , she joined a student house in Whitstable , Kent , sharing a bed and then falling in love with another young woman . They lived there for two winters in what became a six @-@ year relationship . She recalled , \" It was cold , isolated , romantic and so intense \u2014 quite special . \" In 1995 , Waters was at Queen Mary and Westfield College writing her PhD dissertation on gay and lesbian historical fiction from 1870 onward when she became interested in the Victorian era . While learning about the activism in socialism , women 's suffrage , and utopianism of the period , she was inspired to write a work of fiction of the kind that she would like to read . Specifically , Waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting , diverging from previous lesbian @-@ themed books such as Isabel Miller 's Patience and Sarah , in which two women escape an oppressive home life to live together freely in the woods . She said to herself at the time , \" there 's so much more to lesbian history than that \" . Waters was drawn to the Victorian era because of the ( mis ) understandings of what social norms existed during the period . As she stated , \" I find it a fascinating period because it feels very close to us , and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange : many of the things we think we know about it are stereotypes , or simply wrong . \" Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage , Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde , and Chris Hunt , who wrote Street Lavender , an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era . She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender , with a plot similar to My Secret Life by \" Walter \" . Waters pitched Tipping the Velvet to ten British publishers , but after they all rejected it , she began considering American publishing houses . Although she was picked up quickly by a literary agency , the agent spent almost a year trying to sell the book to a mainstream publisher . By the time Tipping the Velvet was accepted by Virago Press \u2014 one of the ten that had previously passed on the project \u2014 Waters had already begun work on her second novel . Nancy \" Nan \" Astley is a sheltered 18 @-@ year @-@ old living with her working @-@ class family and helping in their oyster restaurant in Whitstable , Kent . She becomes instantly and desperately enamoured with a \" <unk> \" , or male impersonator , named Kitty Butler , who performs for a season at the local theatre . They begin a friendship that grows when , after Kitty finds an opportunity to perform in London for better exposure , she asks Nan to join her . Nan enthusiastically agrees and leaves her family to act as Kitty 's dresser while she performs . Although Kitty and Nan acknowledge their relationship to be sisterly , Nan continues to love Kitty until a jealous fight forces Kitty to admit she feels the same , although she insists that they keep their relationship secret . Simultaneously , Kitty 's manager Walter decides that Kitty needs a performing partner to reach true success , and suggests Nan for the role . Nan is initially horrified by the idea , but takes to it . The duo become quite famous until Nan realises she is homesick after being gone from her family for more than a year . Her return home is underwhelming , so she returns to London early to find Kitty in bed with Walter . They announce that the act is finished and they are to be married . Astonished and deeply bruised by the discovery , Nan wanders the streets of London , finally holing herself in a filthy boarding house for weeks in a state of madness until her funds run out . After spying the male costumes she took as her only memory of her time with Kitty , Nan begins to walk the streets of London as a man and easily passes . She is solicited by a man for sex and begins renting , but dressed only as a man for male clients , never letting them know she is a woman . She meets a socialist activist named Florence who lives near the boarding house , but before she can get to know her , Nan is hired by a wealthy widow with licentious tastes named Diana . Although realising \u2014 and initially enjoying \u2014 that she is an object to Diana and her friends , Nan stays with her for over a year as \" Neville \" , dressed in the finest men 's clothes Diana can afford . The relationship erodes , however , and Diana throws Nan into the streets . Nan stumbles through London trying to find Florence , which she eventually does ; Florence is now melancholy , however , with a child . Nan stays with Florence and her brother Ralph , working as their housekeeper . Nan and Florence grow closer during the year they live together , and Nan learns that the previous boarder with Florence and Ralph had a child and died shortly after giving birth . Florence was deeply in love with the boarder but her affections were not returned . During an outing to a women 's pub , Nan is recognised by former fans , to Florence 's astonishment , and Nan divulges her own spotty past to Florence . <unk> , they begin a love affair . Putting her theatrical skills to use , Nan assists Ralph in preparing a speech at an upcoming socialist rally . At the event Nan jumps onstage to help Ralph when he falters , and is noticed once more by Kitty , who asks her to come back so they can continue their affair in secret . Realising how much shame Kitty continues to feel , how much of herself was compromised during their affair , and that her truest happiness is where she is now , Nan turns Kitty away and joins Florence . The greatest literary strengths in Tipping the Velvet , according to reviewers and literary scholars , are the vibrant portrayal of the districts and streets of London , and Waters ' ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters . Her use of synaesthesia in lush descriptions particularly interested Harriet Malinowitz in The Women 's Review of Books . For example , Malinowitz cites the scene when Nan first meets Kitty , removing her glove to shake Kitty 's hand . Very much an oyster girl , Nan 's hands are covered with \" those rank sea @-@ scents , of liquor and oyster @-@ flesh , crab @-@ meat and whelks , which had flavoured my fingers and those of my family for so many years we had ceased , entirely , to notice them . \" Nan is mortified that she smells like a herring , but Kitty assuages her fears , kissing her hand and telling her she instead smells like a mermaid . Malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights , sounds , and smells in Victorian London as examples of elements that are \" breathlessly and wittily detailed \" . Although Waters was born in Pembrokeshire , Wales , she considers herself a London writer because of her intense affection for the city , due in part to her immigration to it . Specifically , Waters is moved by walking through London and seeing remnants of many historical eras : \" It 's ... almost like it 's peopled with ghosts \u2014 again , jostling up against each other or passing through each other . I find that very exciting . \" Her love for the city is apparent to many reviewers . In the Lesbian Review of Books Donna Allegra writes , \" [ S ] he summons the era 's attitudes and ambiance projecting them onto the screen of the reader 's mind with Dolby wrap @-@ around sound such that you feel you 're vacationing on all points between Chelsea and the East End . \" Miranda Seymour in The New York Times remarks on the \" breathless passion \" of the narrator 's voice as being absolutely convincing , citing as an example Nancy 's statement to her sister at the start of the book about why she continues to visit Kitty Butler : ... It 's like I never saw anything at all before . It 's like I am filling up , like a wine @-@ glass when it 's filled with wine . I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing \u2014 they 're like dust . Then she walks on the stage and \u2014 she is so pretty ; and her suit is so nice ; and her voice is so sweet ... She makes me want to smile and weep , at once ... I never saw a girl like her before . I never knew that there were girls like her . Donna Allegra and Christina Patterson in The Observer also praise Nan as a passionate and captivating character . Patterson and Mel Steel in The Independent compare her resourcefulness to that of Moll Flanders . Of her three Victorian @-@ set novels , Waters uses humour and \" an attractive lightness of touch \" most effectively in Tipping the Velvet , according to Paulina Palmer . Nan the narrator describes the irony of her \" curious <unk> career \" as a rent @-@ boy only to end up \u2014 in Diana 's words \u2014 as her \" tart \" . Waters had such fun writing the novel that she told Robert McCrum from The Observer in 2009 that if she had no obligations to meet stemming from her subsequent success as a writer that she would continue writing Nan 's story . Nan 's path through the plot indicates that Tipping the Velvet is part Bildungsroman , and her journeys through the streets of London invoke elements of a picaresque novel . Scholar Emily Jeremiah characterises the story as a Bildungsroman : a coming @-@ of @-@ age adventure but one that far surpasses a simple coming @-@ out story . Stefania Ciocia in Literary London writes that the plot has classical elements of a fairy tale as it follows the main character 's growth and progression , and has a moral ending that includes a course of events where Nan forsakes three suitors for her \u2014 in this case \u2014 Princess Charming . Nan finds true love with Florence , who is a bit dowdy , somewhat stout , certainly not wealthy , and driven to improve the world ; the least likely of all the characters . A review in Publishers Weekly states that the series of events leading to Nan finding love are \" unpredictable and moving \" . Nan 's experiences eventually reveal serious faults of the society she moves through , the primary element of a picaresque novel . For this and other reasons , Waters ' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens ; the reader follows Nan 's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent @-@ boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator , showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals . Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan 's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting , remaining malleable until the end of the novel indicates she is her own worst enemy . Likewise , Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic . Ciocia writes that with half the novel taking place in theatrical settings , Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London . She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage , and later with Kitty , watching how men move and behave to improve their act . She becomes a performer , with Kitty , as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends . Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech . At this point , she is able to reconcile her identity and the story ends . Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot , and was impressed with Iris Murdoch 's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them , a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet . Sexuality and sexual identity is the most prevalent theme in the novel . The title is an obscure Victorian pornographic slang reference to cunnilingus . Nick Rennison in Contemporary British Authors characterises Tipping the Velvet as an \" unabashed and unapologetic celebration of lesbian eroticism and sexual diversity \" . Donna Allegra writes with appreciation of how the existence of Waters ' characters in a heterosexual existence forces an analysis of closeted positions . The sexism of the period puts a stranglehold on women , forcing readers to compare women in the Victorian era with present @-@ day sexual attitudes . Nan never has difficulty accepting her love for Kitty Butler and other women ; Kitty 's union with Walter , however , \" reeks of <unk> \" , according to Allegra . Music halls could be rough in some areas , but Kitty is shown handling drunken and rowdy audiences with humour and grace . The only instance where she is overcome and flees the stage is when a drunken patron shouts a euphemism for a lesbian at her . This episode leads to the final scene of Part I when Nan stumbles upon Kitty and Walter in bed . Kitty does not display any pleasure in their union , but rather <unk> tinged with shame . Allegra compares Kitty 's desire for normality overshadowing her desire for love with Nan to \" compulsory heterosexuality ... emblematic of and particular to lesbian existence \" . Scholar Paulina Palmer asserts that Waters , in Tipping the Velvet and her two following novels also set in the Victorian era \u2014 Affinity and <unk> \u2014 is establishing a literary tradition that has not existed : \" Women engaging in same @-@ sex relationships in the Victorian era were on the whole invisible and we have little knowledge of their literary interests . \" Waters , however , acknowledges that accuracy about lesbian life in the Victorian era is not her primary goal : \" My purpose was not to be authentic , but to imagine a history that we can \u2019 t really recover . \" Short bursts of lesbian @-@ themed literary activity occurred in 1920s with authors such as Natalie Clifford Barney and Djuna Barnes . Another surge of activity published as lesbian pulp fiction occurred in the 1950s and early 1960s , during which several notable lesbian authors such as Ann Bannon and Valerie Taylor helped to establish lesbian literary identity . These fictions helped to inform readers about the lives and cultural landmarks of lesbians when very little information existed . Waters states that she is not on a deliberate crusade to write about lesbians , but that it is a reflection of what she knows : \" Lesbianism is at the top of the agenda for my books because it 's at the top of the agenda for my life . It would be bizarre not to write about it . \" In 2009 , as she reflected on her reasons for writing Tipping the Velvet and <unk> , Waters said she was searching for her own identity as a lesbian writer . Among Waters ' Victorian @-@ set novels , depictions of sexual encounters are also , according to Palmer , the most vivid in Tipping the Velvet . A review in The Advocate calls the book \" riotously sexy \" , and The Seattle Times suggests the scene where Nan shows Kitty how to open and eat an oyster is evocative of Tom Jones . This follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians . Frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour , or employed it as an erotic element controlled by , and for the benefit of , men . Lesbian literary scholar Bonnie Zimmerman writes , \" Lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject the patriarchal stereotype of the lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed . It is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in the closet or under the covers . We don \u2019 t wish to give the world another stick with which to beat us . \" Nan not only experiences a series of misadventures and lesbian relationships , but also shifts from female to male at the same time , giving the reader an opportunity to view London society from multiple perspectives . Gender masquerade and reaction to it permeates the novel . According to Harriet Malinowitz , Waters uses the symbolism of clothing such as skirts , pants , stays , braces , bonnets , ties , and chemises \" with the sort of metaphorical significance that Melville gives to whales \" . Stefania Ciocia declares that in all of 19th century English literature , the only type of character who was able to enjoy adventures native to the picaresque novel were males who acted as the observer or stroller , walking through the city from one district to the next . The single exception to this was Moll Flanders , a prostitute . Nancy Astley behaves as both , giving her the ability to offer her perceptions of London society as both a man and a woman . Music halls , where both Nan and Kitty are employed \u2014 and put on display \u2014 as male impersonators , allow about half the novel 's action and commentary on gender to take place , according to scholar Cheryl Wilson . When Nan puts on trousers for the first time to perform as Kitty 's partner and realises the impact of their double act together , she states , \" whatever successes I might achieve as a girl , they would be nothing compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad , however <unk> , as a boy \" . Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel , and some performers are quite popular . Only certain types of depictions of men , however , were acceptable in reality . Nan and Kitty pretend to be London \" swells \" : gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts . Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions , as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class , and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh at themselves . <unk> such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity . Writing in 1998 about a period more than 100 years before , Waters employs a continuity between the past and present , particularly as it relates to an outsider 's view of sexuality and gender . Diana bestows Nan with the finest gift she had ever received , an expensive watch that requires no winding . She has nowhere to be except at Diana 's beck and call , and never leaves Diana 's mansion without her . Emily Jeremiah uses this as an example of how Tipping the Velvet fits Judith Halberstam 's declaration that homosexual historiographies \" produce alternative temporalities \" . Gay and lesbian stories do not use the same rites of passage that most mainstream stories do , leaving aside the importance of birth , marriage , reproduction , and death . This transcendence of time is evident in the narration of the novel . It is Nan 's first @-@ person account of her own past , told many years later . When Nan divulges her past to Florence , Waters uses the first line of the novel to signify where she begins , cycling the story . Even the novel 's language bridges this divide . Waters often employs the word \" queer \" to describe the unusual or remarkable , instead of its post @-@ 1922 connotation to refer to homosexuality . She also uses the term specifically to highlight what is unusual as it applies to gender , or Nan 's own emotions toward Kitty . Nan 's father uses the symbol of the oyster , what he calls a \" real queer fish \" that exhibits both male and female characteristics , and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they have seen her on stage dressed as a man . The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying <unk> Nan 's first male costume , and is troubled by the \" queerness \" of it because she looks too much like a man , instead of a woman pretending to be a man . Donna Allegra suggests that by using the contemporary term for prostitutes , \" gay girls \" , Waters is winking at her readers . Starting as a working @-@ class girl and experiencing music halls , prostitution , luxury , and a socialist struggle for utopia , Nan 's journeys through the class system in Tipping the Velvet are as varied as her gender portrayals and love affairs . <unk> Sweeney in The Washington Post notes , \" like Dickens , [ Waters ] digs around in the poorhouses , prisons and asylums to come up with characters who not only court and curtsy but dramatise the unfairness of poverty and gender disparity in their time \" . Paulina Palmer sees the reading material available in the various locations of Nan 's settings as symbols of the vast class differences in Victorian London . Specifically , Diana keeps a trunk full of pornographic literature which she and Nan read to each other in between sexual encounters . She is an extremely wealthy resident of the London neighbourhood St John 's Wood , and identifies as a <unk> \u2014 a contemporary term for a lesbian . Nan uses the euphemism \" tom \" throughout the novel , particularly to refer to herself and other working class lesbians . Although \" tom \" was used as a Victorian reference to lesbianism , Waters admits it was probably not as prevalent as her characters suggest it was . Waters includes a historical reference to the medical profession starting to acknowledge and identify female homosexuality in the 19th century when a friend of Diana 's named Dickie reads aloud during a party from a medical text describing the histories of several acknowledged lesbians , including Dickie 's own . One story discussed among the wealthy women at the party is about a young woman with a large clitoris , which they consider congenital in lower @-@ class women . They attempt to prove their point with Diana 's maid Zena , but Nan prevents this humiliation , which precipitates her final rift with Diana . Using Dickie 's book to strike Nan across the face , Diana gives her a black eye and bloody cheek before throwing her out into the street with Zena . Nan goes to Florence 's house , which is filled with socialist literature . Although Diana is a supporter of women 's suffrage , she discourages Nan from reading such literature , confiscating any political material Nan picks up . In contrast , Nan feels hopelessly uninformed when Florence and her friends engage in heated political debates . She asks questions , but feels stupid about not knowing the answers . Florence introduces her to the writings of Walt Whitman , Eleanor Marx , and Edward Carpenter , which they <unk> by using as an introduction to intimacy . Tipping the Velvet was critically acclaimed upon its release and Waters ' writing style highly praised . Harriet Malinowitz wrote that the story is an \" utterly captivating , high octane narrative \" and Mel Steel of The Independent wrote , \" Could this be a new genre ? The bawdy lesbian picaresque novel ? Whatever it is , take it with you . It 's gorgeous . \" Kirkus Reviews also praised it , writing \" Waters ' debut offers terrific entertainment : swiftly paced , crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters \" , comparing the depiction of Nancy 's parents to the fishing community in David Copperfield , and adding that it \" <unk> [ es ] with highly charged ( and explicitly presented ) erotic heat \" . John Perry in The San Francisco Chronicle stated that it \" has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair . Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe , it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader marveling at the author 's craftsmanship , idiosyncrasy and sheer effort . \" Perry did acknowledge , however , that modern optimism was probably the impetus driving Waters ' vision of a lesbian past . Christina Patterson called Waters \" an extremely confident writer , combining precise , sensuous descriptions with irony and wit in a skilled , multi @-@ layered pastiche of the lesbian historical romance . \" Renee Graham 's review in The Boston Globe characterised the novel 's style as \" plush and inviting \u2014 delicious , even \" . In The New York Times , Miranda Seymour drew attention to the scene when Nan dresses up as Hadrian 's lover , the page Antinous who was drowned in the Nile , for a masquerade benefiting Diana 's friends in a hedonistic <unk> that ends violently with Nan cast out of the house into the cold , highlighting it as a passage of \" startling power \" . Although Seymour was disappointed with the ending , she wrote , \" If lesbian fiction is to reach a wider readership \u2014 as much , though far from all , of it deserves to do \u2014 Waters is just the person to carry the banner . \" Several reviewers compared Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson 's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for a similar story of a woman 's sexual awakening . Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing , but states that the books are quite different and her writing is not like Winterson 's at all . Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson was the only other lesbian author they could recall . The popularity of her first novel cast a standard for Affinity to follow , which Waters consciously made darker , set in a women 's prison with a character who connects with spirits of the dead . Waters found it daunting to follow the success of Tipping the Velvet and reviewers marked the differences in the main characters : where Nan <unk> seeks out and states her desires , Margaret in Affinity is compelled by desire , but internally struggles with it . Tipping the Velvet won the Lambda Literary Award for lesbian fiction in 2000 , and the Betty Trask Award , given to Commonwealth citizens who have produced their first novel before reaching the age of 35 . The Library Journal chose it as one of their Best Books of the Year for 1999 , and the New York Times included it on its list of Notable Books of the Year . Tipping the Velvet was adapted into a BBC television drama serial of the same name , originally screened in three episodes on BBC Two in 2002 . It was produced for the BBC by the independent production company Sally Head Productions , and starred Rachael Stirling as Nan , Keeley Hawes as Kitty , Anna Chancellor as Diana , and Jodhi May as Florence . The BBC had previously adapted Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990 and some other scenes in dramas to follow , but none had been so explicit . Sally Head Productions defended the decision to air the entire program uncut . Waters was quite surprised that the BBC chose to produce and broadcast a television adaptation that faithfully followed the relish and detail of sexual escapades in the book . Stirling thoroughly enjoyed the role , despite her avowed heterosexuality : \" To counteract any hard @-@ core sex within it , there 's a huge sense of humour and a huge sense of fun and frivolity and joy of life . It was so utterly believable that you never for a moment thought , Fuck , there 's no reason why I 'm standing here naked . \" Screenwriter Andrew Davies said he was attracted to the story because it featured a girl transitioning into womanhood and it included his interests in Victorian erotica ; he compared it to Pride and Prejudice \u2014 for which he wrote the BBC screenplay \u2014 \" with dirty bits \" . Both Waters and Davies were concerned about the use of dildos in scenes with Diana , but the BBC allowed it . When news releases told of the BBC featuring swearing and sex toys , the Daily Mail reported that viewers began to protest . BBC representatives downplayed the gratuitousness of the story , comparing it to Moll Flanders . Waters especially appreciated the way Davies interpreted Kitty 's ambivalence about being in love with Nan . He wrote the line for her , \" I hate the way you make me feel \" , which according to Waters crystallises Kitty 's complicated emotions well . The music in the adaptation was written for the film . Waters wrote song titles but not lyrics in the music references in the novel . For one song , during Kitty and Nan 's first performance in the adaptation , Davies wrote a composition that had Kitty show Nan \u2014 dressed and performing as brothers \u2014 how to pick up girls in the park . It involved Kitty teaching Nan how to kiss , which they do onstage in front of audiences who are watching women , dressed as men , who are in reality having an affair with each other beyond the view of the audience . Waters wrote a similar description as Nan compares their act to their relationship ; their sexual encounters to their performance onstage , noting the irony that Kitty insisted on absolute secrecy yet there they performed in front of thousands : \" You are too slow \u2014 you go too fast \u2014 not there , but here \u2014 that 's good \u2014 that 's better ! It was as if we walked before the crimson curtain , lay down upon the boards and kissed and <unk> \u2014 and were clapped , and cheered , and paid for it ! \" A persistent rumour claims a film adaptation of Tipping the Velvet will be directed by Sofia Coppola , starring Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Eva Longoria . However , Longoria insists that everything about the rumour is false , right down to quotes cited to her and Knowles . Knowles also wonders where the false quotes and story originate from . In 2009 , UK playwright Amanda Whittington wrote a stage adaptation of Tipping the Velvet . It was showcased by Guildhall School of Music and Drama at The Bridewell Theatre , London , in October 2009 . Directed by Katharine Rogers , the production featured original music hall songs and was praised for its authentic interpretation of the novel . On 14 April 2015 , it was announced the play would receive its world premiere the same year and would begin previews at the Lyric Hammersmith on 18 September 2015 , with an official opening night on 28 September , booking for a limited period until 24 October . Following its premiere production the play is scheduled to transfer to the Royal Lyceum Theatre , Edinburgh , as part of the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Lyceum Theatre company , where it will run from 28 October to 14 November 2015 . Tipping the Velvet has been adapted for the stage by Laura Wade and is directed by Lyndsey Turner , with choreography by Alistair David , design by Lizzie Clachan , lighting design by Jon Clark , music by Michael Bruce and sound by Nick Manning ."]}, {"title": ["Nan Kempner\u2019s grandkids launch fashions at SF Nordstrom"], "text": ["Image 1 of 10 |Meggie Kempner's fashion line\n\nA thigh-high slit skirt adds youthful appeal to womenswear from Kempner's spring/summer 2015 collection, now at select Nordstrom stores nationwide.\n\nImage 1 of 10 - Meggie Kempner's fashion line\n\nA thigh-high slit skirt adds youthful appeal to womenswear from Kempner's spring/summer 2015 collection, now at select Nordstrom stores nationwide.\n\nA thigh-high slit skirt adds youthful appeal to womenswear from...Kempner's spring/summer 2015 collection, now at select Nordstrom...stores nationwide.\n\nImage 2 of 10 |Meggie Kempner's fashion line\n\nIt's a family affair: Chris Kempner, at left, and his sister, Meggie Kempner, are the driving forces behind the new Kempner womenswear line of clothing.

It quickly passed, however, as the Democrats reveled in the glow of winning control of the House even while nervously watching Senate returns trickle in.\n\nFrom a hotel ballroom in the shadow of the Capitol in Washington to statehouses to private vote-watching gatherings across the United States, Democrats celebrated their victories.\n\nYet even as they savored a still-unfolding success story, they tested their ability to stick to a basic principle of their agreed upon game plan: no gloating allowed.\n\n\u0093The news has arrived!\u0094 declared Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who was a prime engineer of the party\u0092s comeback. \u0093You have given us a chance to bring this country around, and we\u0092ll bring you a government that no longer lets you down.\u0094\n\nAs the speakers blared \u0093Start Me Up\u0094 by the Rolling Stones at the Washington ballroom, Mr. Emanuel and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, his Senate counterpart, came out dancing and clapping. While control of the Senate was still in doubt, Mr. Emanuel\u0092s victory was clear, so he pumped his fist in the air and addressed a jubilant crowd. Later, he received a congratulatory call from Ken Mehlman, the Republican Party chairman.\n\nAs Mr. Emanuel tried to thank a list of people who had helped gain the victory, the crowd demanded to see the woman who would become the first female speaker of the House: \u0093Nan-cy! Nan-cy!\u0094 On risers close to the stage, young celebrants jumped up and down, yelling: \u0093Speaker! Speaker! Speaker!\u0094\n\nThen, in short order, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California took the stage.\n\n\u0093Today we have made history,\u0094 Ms. Pelosi said. \u0093Now let us make progress.\u0094 The elation, which had been slowly building in recent weeks, was felt across the nation. In Indiana, long a red state, Democrats captured three House seats from Republicans. It was a sign, Democrats said, that the country was longing for a new direction.\n\n\u0093The lesson of this election is clear \u0097 we won by turning the red states of the heartland blue,\u0094 said Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, who spent the last several days crisscrossing his state on behalf of Democratic candidates. \u0093Indiana, which has voted for the Republicans in 16 of the last 17 presidential elections, sent three new Democrats to Congress. This is not an accident.\u0094\n\nThroughout the day, Democrats had been superstitiously trying to tamp down expectations. Mr. Emanuel and Ms. Pelosi made limited public appearances, going only briefly before television cameras. Ms. Pelosi\u0092s staff took out lanyards imprinted \u0093speakerpelosi.com\u0094 to give to staff members and visitors to the Democratic headquarters.

He had seen promising exit polls before, namely in 2004, when John Kerry appeared to be the next president on the afternoon of Election Day.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ve had my heart broken before,\u0094 Mr. Reid said. \u0093I thought I\u0092d won over the woman, only to look into the bedroom and see her with another man.\u0094\n\nMelissa Moss, a loyal and longtime party activist in Washington, could barely contain her delight after receiving word that Democrats had won control of the House. It was a political emotion that she worried her party might have forgotten.\n\n\u0093We\u0092ve had our chops busted pretty good for the last several years,\u0094 said Ms. Moss, a former national finance director for the party. \u0093We\u0092ve lost one election and we\u0092ve had one stolen. There is sort of a feeling of a renaissance. It really does feel like a new day, and we\u0092ve been in the darkness.\u0094\n\nSenator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, spent the evening in Chicago making congratulatory calls. In an interview, he declared: \u0093Democrats have a wonderful opportunity to show that we have an agenda for change.\u0094\n\nIn the ballroom of the Hyatt Hotel in Washington, flag-waving, dancing Democrats erupted in cheers as two television screens covering the walls at the front announced a series Democratic winners for the House.\n\nThe loudest applause went to Tim Mahoney, who won the seat held by Representative Mark Foley, who resigned in September after sending sexually explicit e-mail messages to young Congressional pages \u0097 a final scandal that helped vault Democrats to their victory.

But unlike his previous arrests during the protest movement, Mr. Besigye was not granted bail on Thursday, and was later whisked away to a prison far outside of the city.\n\nNorbert Mao, another jailed former presidential candidate who is leading protests, was transferred to the same prison outside of Kampala, indicating a growing sensitivity on the part of the government to the politicians\u2019 provocations and influence.\n\nUntil Thursday, the protesters in Kampala seemed only as bold as the senior politicians often at the front of the march. But with the leaders jailed, the demonstrations on Thursday grew on their own and evolved into a violent parade of protesters, some holding up banners attacking government corruption, and many with rocks.\n\n\u201cThe situation is pushing us,\u201d said Jamo Luyombya, 24, a day laborer. \u201cThey are controlling us with the power of the gun, but not with their power of love.\u201d\n\nIn Kampala, heavily armed soldiers and police officers fought running street battles with stone-wielding protesters through a popular market as thousands stood on rooftops and balconies to watch.\n\nIn the town of Masaka, far from journalists covering the protests in Kampala, a 2-year-old was killed after being shot in the chest and head when the police opened fire with live ammunition near a crowd of unarmed protesters, according to Ugandan news reports.\n\nMany more were reported wounded in Masaka, and two police officers were hospitalized after being severely beaten by protesters there, the police said. A news report said that the two officers had died on the way to the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe Ugandan government must immediately end the excessive use of force against protesters,\u201d Amnesty International said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThe police have a duty to protect themselves and uphold the law, but it is completely unacceptable to fire live ammunition at peaceful protesters.\u201d\n\nThe events could prove pivotal for a movement that so far has failed to gain the same momentum and social cohesion as protests over similar concerns in northern Africa.\n\n\u201cThe rioting shows that people need change of government,\u201d said Annek Cabine, a bystander at the market where the protest came through. \u201cOtherwise, this problem could become like Libya.\u201d\n\nBut many still see the protest movement as contrived, propped up by politicians bitter over brutal electoral losses. Others wonder whether it has a chance of displacing Mr. Museveni, who has been in power for a quarter-century.\n\n\u201cThe key to regime change is of course the army,\u201d said Dr. Elliot Green, a Uganda specialist at the London School of Economics, who said that Mr. Museveni had \u201cdone well\u201d in keeping the army \u201cin his pocket.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Green said Africa had a long history of urban food riots that brought down governments.\n\n\u201cObviously the current situation in Burkina Faso should also worry Museveni, where a riot by soldiers was sparked by a food riot,\u201d said Dr. Green. \u201cMuseveni has a lot to be worried about.\u201d"], "summary": ["A fourth round of street demonstrations over commodity prices broke out Thursday in Kampala after a leading opposition politician was arrested for the third time in two weeks."]}, {"title": ["How Sharpton gets paid to not cry \u2018racism\u2019 at corporations"], "text": ["Want to influence a casino bid?

Although the money was ostensibly to support NAN\u2019s efforts to bring \u201ceducational equality,\u201d it also came at a time that Plainfield was trying to get a lucrative gambling deal in New York.\n\nPlainfield had a $250 million stake in Capital Play, a group trying to secure a license to run the coming racino at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens. Capital Play employed a lobbyist named Charlie King, who also was the acting executive director of NAN.\n\nSharpton has said that most of the Plainfield contribution went to pay King\u2019s salary.\n\nKing\u2019s company, the Movement Group, was paid $243,586 by NAN in 2008, tax records show.\n\nHarold Levy, a former New York City schools chancellor who was a managing director at Plainfield at the time, has denied the contribution was made to curry favor with Sharpton or anyone else. But a year later, as the battle for the racino license heated up, NAN raked in another $100,000 from representatives of the AEG consortium, which was the successor company to Capital Play.\n\nOne AEG member e-mailed another in 2009 saying, \u201cSharpton lobbied [then-Gov. David Paterson] hard over the weekend on our behalf,\u201d according to the state inspector general\u2019s 2010 report on the corrupt racino licensing process.\n\nHarold Levy, a former Plainfield director, denied the company donated to NAN for Sharpton\u2019s favor.Photo: Thomas Hinton\n\nIn order to discredit SL Green, one of the rival bidders whose plan included a Hard Rock Hotel, an AEG executive sent another e-mail outlining tactics to conscript local leaders to its cause.\n\n\u201cWe are going to need it, and we are going to need . . . Sharpton to piss on hard rock,\u201d according to the undated e-mail cited in the IG\u2019s report.\n\nSharpton denied he lobbied on behalf of AEG.\n\nThe donations, meanwhile, came at an opportune time for Sharpton, as NAN was deep in debt to the IRS in 2008. It owed $1.3 million in unpaid federal, state and city payroll taxes including interest and penalties.\n\nAEG viewed its payments to Sharpton as more of an insurance policy so he wouldn\u2019t scuttle its chances by criticizing the group, said a source familiar with the racino controversy.\n\nSharpton raised $1 million for NAN at his 60th birthday bash in October, with donations rolling in from unions and a corporate roster of contributors including AT&T, McDonald\u2019s, Verizon and Walmart.\n\nCompanies have long gotten in line to pay Sharpton.

Then, in 2006, Sharpton threatened a boycott of GM over the planned closing of an African-American-owned dealership in The Bronx. He picketed outside GM\u2019s Fifth Avenue headquarters. GM wrote checks to NAN for $5,000 in 2007 and another $5,000 in 2008.\n\nSharpton targeted American Honda in 2003 for not hiring enough African-Americans in management positions.\n\n\u201cWe support those that support us,\u201d Sharpton wrote to the company. \u201cWe cannot be silent while African-Americans spend hard-earned dollars with a company that does not hire, promote or do business with us in a statistically significant manner.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, car-company leaders met with Sharpton, and Honda began to sponsor NAN\u2019s events.

He held the position until 2007\n\nAs for Sony, Sharpton denied that his meeting with Pascal resulted in a donation to NAN.\n\n\u201cI have had no discussion with her about money.\u201d Sharpton told The Post. \u201cThere was never even a remote discussion about money.\u201d Additional reporting by Amber Jamieson"], "summary": ["Want to influence a casino bid?
