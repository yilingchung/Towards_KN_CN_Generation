But good facilities, both for sports and arts, are backed up by enthusiastic teaching and a laudably generous allocation of time to non-academic matters.

Bored with the three Rs? Then try film studies, photography, dance, psychology or, gulp, accounting. It's a good mix of the traditional and cutting-edge. The IT provision is particularly impressive.\n\nExtra-curricular: Students are required to spend at least one time-slot a week doing something non-academic. They are spoilt for choice: outstanding sports facilities are complemented by impressively busy theatre and music facilities to suit every taste, and there are bags of after-hours clubs, trips, etc.\n\nLeague table standing: It's one of the strongest sixth form colleges in the country.

This has been the strictly gendered story of school uniform since long before the days of Tom Brown putting on a top hat and tails to learn his times tables or the girls of Hamlet of Radcliff school pitching up in starched aprons with gloves (seriously). Now the rules appear to be relaxing, as 80 state schools across the UK, including 40 primaries, have introduced gender-neutral policies allowing girls to wear trousers (which, beyond the school gate, many of us have been doing for at least a century) and boys to wear skirts.\n\n\u201cWe introduced the policy more than a year ago,\u201d Paula Weaver, headteacher at Allens Croft primary school in Birmingham, tells me. The school is thought to be the first state primary in the country to make their uniform policy explicitly gender-neutral, changing the wording and linking in staff, governors and parents.\n\nIn practice, what does this mean? \u201cThat children are expected to wear uniform, but they can wear whatever part of that uniform they want,\u201d is her no-nonsense answer.\n\nFor other schools it\u2019s about removing references to a pupil\u2019s gender in uniform dress codes. \u201cThis year we\u2019ve gone from a girls\u2019 uniform and a boys\u2019 uniform to a skirt uniform and a trousers uniform,\u201d explains Liana Richards, deputy head teacher at Uplands Community College, a state secondary in East Sussex. \u201cIt\u2019s about recognising the rights of students who feel they might not fit into the binary genders. It\u2019s less of a big deal to the students than you might think. We haven\u2019t seen that much difference yet, although some girls have made the conscious decision to wear the trousers uniform, which has to be worn with a tie.\u201d\n\nThe move is part of a government-funded drive to support LGBT+ children in schools and be more open to children questioning their gender or sexual identity. It follows the decision in January by the 170-year-old private school Brighton College to scrap uniform rules for trans pupils. Research by Educate and Celebrate, a charity giving LGBT+ inclusive training to school staff, found that 53% of schools don\u2019t teach about LGBT+ relationships and 49% don\u2019t teach the definitions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans+.\n\nAllens Croft and Uplands Community College are two of a number of primaries and secondaries designated a \u201cbest practice school\u201d by Educate and Celebrate for, among other things, its gender-neutral uniform policy. \u201cIt\u2019s in line with the ethos of our school,\u201d Weaver explains. \u201cIt ties in with our equality work around homophobic and transphobic bullying and eradicating the negative use of the word \u2018gay\u2019. We believe that children have the right to express their own identity in a way that is most comfortable for them.\u201d\n\nHas there been any backlash from parents? \u201cNone at all,\u201d she insists. \u201cThe thing is, we\u2019re not insisting on anyone doing anything. It\u2019s not about influencing children. It\u2019s about giving them choice.\u201d\n\nWhat about the pupils? Are they turning up in every uniform combination under the sun? Apparently not. \u201cWe still have the battle with children who don\u2019t wear uniform,\u201d she notes. \u201cWe still have more trouser-wearing across the board than boys wearing skirts.

The exchange\u2014a representative for the rap group says it was an \u201cinquiry,\u201d while GoldieBlox claims the call was threatening\u2014led the toy company to file a preemptive lawsuit against the Beastie Boys, producer Rick Rubin and the group\u2019s record label, Universal Music. GoldieBlox is claiming that their use of \u201cGirls\u201d does not constitute copyright infringement because of the fair use doctrine, which allows people to use copyrighted materials in new works for transformative purposes.\n\nWhether the Beastie Boys would have actually sued GoldieBlox is unclear, but the case will now be reviewed by the U.S. District Court in Northern California. The outcome could have big implications for the use of parodies in commercials, particularly in an age when remixing and redistributing media is easier than ever before.\n\n(MORE: Why Apple Hasn\u2019t Managed to Kill Pandora Yet)\n\nThe fair use doctrine has long been wielded to protect musical expression, perhaps most famously in the 1994 Supreme Court decision ruling that 2 Live Crew\u2019s bawdy take on \u201cPretty Woman\u201d was a legal parody of Roy Orbison\u2019s original. But using a song in an explicitly commercial context, like the GoldieBlox ad, limits its protection from copyright infringement lawsuits. \u201cWhether or not a work is used for a commercial purpose has been part of the fair use analysis for a very long time,\u201d says Andy Sellars, a staff attorney for the Digital Media Law Project housed at Harvard University. \u201cThe use of media in advertising has often been a tough place for people to make fair use claims.\u201d\n\nGoldieBlox\u2019s argument rests on the idea that their video is both a parody, generally protected by the fair use doctrine, and an important public policy statement on the educational opportunities for women. \u201cGoldieBlox created its parody video specifically to comment on the Beastie Boys song, and to further the company\u2019s goal to break down gender stereotypes and to encourage young girls to engage in activities that challenge their intellect, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math,\u201d the company wrote in its claim.\n\nHowever, the Beastie Boys have taken a strong stance against the use of their music in advertisements. Member Adam Yauch (aka MCA), who died of cancer in 2012, explicitly stated in his will that his music should not be used for advertising purposes, according to Rolling Stone. Shortly after MCA\u2019s death, the group sued Monster Energy Drink for the unauthorized use of their songs in a promotional video on the company\u2019s website. In an open letter published Monday, surviving members Mike D and Ad-Rock reemphasized their anti-commercial sentiment, writing directly to GoldieBlox, \u201cAs creative as it is, make no mistake, your video is an advertisement that is designed to sell a product, and long ago, we made a conscious decision not to permit our music and/or name to be used in product ads.\u201d\n\nThere are examples both sides can highlight to prove their legal point. MGM won an injunction against Honda in 1995 to stop a series of car ads that imitated famous scenes and characters from the James Bond films a little too directly. In 2004 Eminem sued Apple and MTV for a an iTunes commercial that featured 10-year-old boy singing his hit song \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d The parties eventually settled out of court.\n\nParamount Pictures was sued over this poster promoting Naked Gun 33 1/3, but the courts ruled that it did not violate copyright law.\n\nBut there are others cases where parody ads have been ruled legal. In 1991 Paramount Pictures created a promotional poster for a Naked Gun sequel featuring Leslie Nielsen in the same pose as a very pregnant Demi Moore on the cover of Vanity Fair. Annie Leibovitz, the creator of the Vanity Fair photo, sued Paramount, but the courts ruled that the poster was clearly a parody and therefore legal under fair use.\n\n(MORE: Emojis, Exploding Coupons Could Be in Snapchat\u2019s Future)\n\nThese types of legal confrontations could become more common as advertising broadens outside the world of traditional ad agencies. \u201cThe way it\u2019s normally done on Madison Avenue is to get permission. There\u2019s what they call a clearance culture,\u201d Sellars says. \u201cThe idea of fair use is that you don\u2019t need permission.\u201d\n\nThe GoldieBlox video was conceptualized by the company\u2019s executives and produced by The Academy, a production studio that mostly develops short films. A traditional ad agency might have raised red flags on using the Beastie Boys song, but none were involved.\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious irony to this case. The Beastie Boys are constantly in legal battles over their wide and varied sampling of older music. Copyright infringement suits against 1989\u2019s Paul\u2019s Boutique are still kicking around in the courts. But the conflict with GoldieBlox shows that today, any piece of media is ripe to be reinterpreted (or perhaps exploited) by anybody at any time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different type of advertising than we\u2019re used to seeing.,\u201d Sellars says. \u201cWe\u2019re finding people expressing themselves in new and different ways in ways that would have made old gatekeepers nervous.\u201d"], "summary": ["It was the kind of video you could tell would go viral the moment you watched it.

I would answer: not that incredible. The headteacher, who was sacked in December, would not want a scandal to break at his school. He would prefer to believe that nothing was up. So the Ofsted inspectors continued to be hoodwinked, writing in 2009 that \"pupils feel exceptionally safe and secure because they know that staff have their well-being at heart\".\n\nIn short, a good Ofsted report \u2013 even an \"outstanding\" one \u2013 is no guarantee that things are in order at your child's school.

When I went to [Jamiatul Ummah] school I was taught about all these other opinions; in the madrassah I was taught one opnion,\u201d Asif said.\n\nOfsted\u2019s inspectors criticised Jamiatul Ummah for failing to develop pupils\u2019 understanding of \u201cthe fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance\u201d.\n\nA teaching assistant at one of the schools ridiculed Wilshaw\u2019s assertion that the schools were preparing pupils poorly for British life. \u201cThis is east London.

The question of whether she can make that choice freely in a society that vigorously polices her appearance and sexual expression is a valid one. But such questions have been asked many times before, and Sales doesn\u2019t bring much that is new to the debate.\n\nNor does she have much to say about social media\u2019s more positive applications. While new platforms have opened up new avenues for harassment, they have also enabled new forms of activism, and young people have often been the first to adopt them. Kira, one of the only black girls in her graduating class at a Manhattan private high school, points out that social media has helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cSome people are using social media to promote themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cBut other people are using it as a way to try and really change our society for the better.\u201d\n\nShe is one of the few girls in the book to make this point, and Sales could have delved deeper into the ways girls use social media to push back against the pressures they face, online and off. I wanted to hear more from the \u201cfeminist girls\u201d one 17-year-old describes: \u201cThey express themselves, they stick up for themselves and they, like, put feminist things on social media.\u201d\n\nSales wrote a Vanity Fair story last year on the effect of Tinder and other dating apps on contemporary sexuality. In it, college women complained that men their age had no interest in courtship or even basic politeness \u2014 \u201cTinder has destroyed their game.\u201d And 20-something male Tinder aficionados made a variety of repellent comments suggesting women are disposable and interchangeable: \u201cIf you had a reservation somewhere and then a table at Per Se opened up, you\u2019d want to go there,\u201d one of them said.\n\nIn \u201cAmerican Girls,\u201d Sales argues that the same problem affects even young teenagers. She writes of \u201cboys who never want to make a definite plan; who seem to be leaving all their options open; and who seem to assume that girls are waiting with bated breath for boys to appear at their door, or at least to text them.\u201d\n\nBut social media didn\u2019t create boys like this \u2014 as Amanda Marcotte at Slate put it in response to the Vanity Fair story, \u201cgross dudes were not invented by apps.\u201d Sales does point out real double standards for male and female sexual behavior, which have been far slower to change than technology. (While she talks to gay teenagers \u2014 one girl says friends of her ex-girlfriend harassed her on social media after the two broke up \u2014 most of her discussions of dating and sexuality focus on heterosexual kids.) But there\u2019s something exhausting about hearing, yet again, that boys and young men can\u2019t be bothered to be boyfriends; critics of hookup culture have been repeating that claim since some of Sales\u2019s subjects were in diapers.\n\n\u201cAmerican Girls\u201d is also limited by its single-gender focus. While Sales talks to some older boys and young men, male voices are largely absent from the sections dealing with younger teenagers. The choice makes sense in a way \u2014 girls seem to suffer sexualized harassment and shaming on social media more frequently than boys do. But excluding boys\u2019 perspectives gives readers an incomplete view of the problem and its potential solutions.\n\nDo boys, too, feel pressure to present a certain image \u2014 maybe that of a player who\u2019s talking to lots of girls? What do they think when their friends demand nude pictures from girls or harass them online? Do they ever feel guilty about how they treat girls on social media? What, if anything, might get them to change?\n\nSales\u2019s conversations with male college students hint at some answers to these questions. One of them, Ethan, is intriguingly conflicted about his social-media-enabled sex life. He boasts of \u201ca scoring average higher than Kobe Bryant\u201d and says he has no problem cheating on girls: \u201cMy friends are like, She\u2019s not gonna find out \u2014 you can have the main course and some appetizers, too.\u201d But, Sales writes, \u201che\u2019d been cheated on; he still didn\u2019t seem over it.\u201d And Ethan says he wishes he lived \u201cwhen you had to go knock on the door and ask the dad for permission.\u201d\n\nThis time (which Ethan somewhat amusingly puts \u201cin the \u201970s\u201d) wasn\u2019t necessarily a happy one for women \u2014 many jeremiads about today\u2019s sexual freedoms forget the oppressiveness that came before. But Sales doesn\u2019t probe Ethan\u2019s odd and possibly illuminating mixture of bravado and romanticism. And while she does mention the lack of female representation in Silicon Valley, she doesn\u2019t spend much time discussing what tech companies could do to fix some of the problems she identifies. The effect is to make apps like Facebook and Twitter seem static and unchangeable, when in fact they change all the time, and their corporate owners could modify them to protect younger users.\n\nIt feels a bit strange to call for more talk of boys and big corporations in a book about girls. But when it comes to dating and sex, teenage girls are already subject to near-constant scrutiny, and they\u2019re too often considered in isolation, as though the dangers and injustices they face are entirely theirs to solve. By focusing almost exclusively on how girls suffer, Sales repeats the usual unhelpful and defeatist refrain: It\u2019s a terrible world out there, and girls have to navigate it all on their own.\n\nAnna North is a staff editor for The Times\u2019s opinion pages.

The author, Richard Whitmire, argues that the basic problem is that verbal skills have become more important, while boys haven\u2019t become more verbal, and that seems a plausible explanation. Incidentally, it\u2019s notable that other countries seem to have faced up to the issue more openly. Boys are lagging (except at the very top of the curve) throughout the OECD countries, but other countries seem more willing to study the gender gap and act upon it. In the U.S., it seems more of a taboo.\n\nIncidentally, this shouldn\u2019t be seen as a zero sum game, or a battle of the sexes. If boys lag, that\u2019s not good for girls, either. And we should be able to help struggling boys without imposing any cost on girls.\n\nI\u2019m curious about you who are teachers or parents: do you see this phenomenon?

Checking her makeup one last time, she joins her two younger sisters in a provocative dance.\n\nThe Gypsy girl knows she has to look her best. She is, after all, on an important life mission: catching the eye of one of the hundreds of young Gypsy guys prowling around what locals have dubbed the \"bridal market\" to initiate a complex ritual of haggling that could lead to marriage.\n\nLove's not exactly for sale here. But in the litter-strewn parking lot that hosts the fair, amid blaring Gypsy pop and saucy flirtation, negotiations are churning quietly behind the scenes as families weigh their financial compatibility along with the merits of the prospective bride.\n\nOften, the future of entire families is in the balance as these Roma, among the most poverty-stricken people in a deeply impoverished region, seek to forge mutually beneficial unions that will help them weather Bulgaria's brutal economic downturn.\n\nGlobalization adds to the economic pressures. The families gathered here are part of a community of about 18,000 Roma known as Kalaidzhi, who traditionally make a living as coppersmiths. That trade is dying out, in part because traditional copper pots and pans are being replaced by less expensive goods from China.\n\nStill, a festive atmosphere reigns at the bridal fair.\n\nMost of the girls, even those too young to be considered for marriage, wear gobs of mascara, flashy jewelry and towering high-heels. The colors of the mini-dresses are flashy: electric pinks, blood reds, canary yellows. The boys wear tight black jeans and muscle shirts, often topped with a black leather jacket. The bleak surroundings don't dampen spirits: Some 2,000 people have shown up, many in cars rigged with speakers on the hoods to pump out Gypsy pop at full blast. Boys and girls dance side-by-side on the cars, shaking their hips in frenzy.\n\nThe exuberance stems largely from the fact that, due to the community's conservative values, the youths are so rarely allowed to mingle with the opposite sex. Kalaidzhi, who are almost all devout Orthodox Christians, are known to remove girls from school at 15 or even earlier to keep them from mixing with boys.\n\n\"I hope to meet new people and to see the parents of the boys, so our parents can meet him,\" says Hristova, who, at 19, is prime marrying age. \"It's a good tradition. It's easier for us if our parents approve.\"\n\nIt starts, like a high school dance, with groups of boys and girls in separate clumps, occasionally shaking hands and checking each other out \u2014 while mom and dad stay discreetly in the background.\n\nApart from these twice-a-year bridal fairs, boys and girls only have contact in Internet chats. So Hristova is happy to leave the realm of Facebook and meet real young men. And at the fair, there is no shortage of youths held in thrall by the way she dances with her sisters, who also wear their showiest clothes.\n\n\"I want to find someone who is easy to get along with,\" she says, taking a pause from dancing in high-heeled sandals \u2014 \"someone whose parents won't interfere after we are together, and someone who's not too rich and not too poor and has a job.\"\n\nThe event's reputation as a \"bridal market\" goes back generations. It used to take place in a muddy open field next to a horse-trading market in a small village, until police moved it into the city this year to avoid tension between the two pursuits. A generation ago, brides-to-be stood on stage with suitors competing for their hand. Those days are over.\n\nStill, the flirtations can lead to negotiations and a possible union a few months down the road. If the youths warm to each other, the fair can trigger complex financial negotiations about the price a young man's family must pay to a woman's parents if they are to wed.\n\nThe cost of a bride \u2014 between 5,000 and 10,000 lev ($3,000 to $6,600) \u2014 has dropped in recent years as jobs have dried up. And wedding festivities are much more modest with cash so tight. But prices still rise for a \"very beautiful\" young woman with many suitors, said Velcho Krastev, who has written extensively about the Kalaidzhi.\n\nSome contend this is an innocent payment for the cost of a wedding dress and the elaborate wedding feasts Roma favor. Others call it is the price families are willing to pay for their sons to win a woman believed to be a virgin.\n\n\"We are maintaining the morals of the children by marrying them off at a young age,\" said Kosta Kostov, a spectator at the fair. \"If she's not a virgin, the bride's family has to give the money back.\"\n\nHe said Bulgaria's crushing financial slowdown, and the near total collapse of the coppersmith industry, has made it virtually impossible for his family to raise the money needed to find wives for his three grandsons, aged 18, 20 and 22.\n\n\"They have no jobs and their parents can't pay money to the bride's family,\" he said. \"It's a crisis now.\"\n\nThe idea that a young woman must be a virgin when she marries has generally faded in many segments of Bulgarian society during the last 50 years. But it remains strong among the tradition-minded Roma, particularly those who follow Orthodox teachings.\n\nThe Kalaidzhi, unlike other Roma communities, do not allow girls to marry at an extremely young age \u2014 most are 18 or older. And they have started to modernize: It is widely recognized that the young people need to have feelings for each other.\n\n\"That is the first and most important step now,\" said Krastev, a member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. \"In the past, parents didn't ask the young people whether they liked each other. But the second step is that when they have decided they like each other and the parents agree, they start negotiating what the price will be for the bride.\"\n\nTalk of brides being sold causes bristling among the Kalaidzhi, who represent a small proportion of Bulgaria's 700,000 Roma. They say the marriage fair is a tradition that actually works, keeping communities and extended families intact for generations.\n\nIndeed, it is easy to find men and women in their late 30s and early 40s who met at a bridal fair two decades ago and today are hoping now to make matches for their children. Many who found a mate here five or six years ago come back to help their younger siblings or cousins get hitched.\n\nPepa Georgieva married her husband Kolyo in 2008 after a courtship sparked at the bridal fair. She came to this year's event to help her 20-year-old cousin navigate the sea of suitors.\n\n\"She is nervous and there are several grooms possible,\" Georgieva said. \"She has not decided, and she can't decide by herself. We are asking her opinion but she also has to recognize our opinion.\"\n\nThat opinion doesn't hinge on the groom alone.\n\n\"I am here to meet the families,\" she said \u2014 \"to see if they have the wealth to support the bride.\"\n\nValentina Petrova and Veselin Toshkov contributed to this report."], "summary": ["Donka Hristova lets her mother pull her skintight mini-dress a half-inch down her leg.

It is the first major criticism and scrutiny by some of Obama\u2019s top supporters over a program that has also been heralded as a much needed effort to address the particular problems faced by young men and boys of color.\n\nIn an open letter, publicized by the African American Policy Forum and signed by writer Alice Walker, lawyers Anita Hill and Mary Frances Berry and actress Rosario Dawson, among other leading academics and activists, the coalition of women asks that Obama \u201cre-align this important initiative to reflect the values of inclusion, equal opportunity and shared fate that have propelled our historic struggle for racial justice forward.\u201d\n\nWhile we applaud the efforts on the part of the White House, private philanthropy, social justice organizations and others to move beyond colorblind approaches to race-specific problems, we are profoundly troubled about the exclusion of women and girls of color from this critical undertaking. The need to acknowledge the crisis facing boys should not come at the expense of addressing the stunted opportunities for girls who live in the same households, suffer in the same schools, and struggle to overcome a common history of limited opportunities caused by various forms of discrimination.\n\nWe simply cannot agree that the effects of these conditions on women and girls should pale to the point of invisibility, and are of such little significance that they warrant zero attention in the messaging, research and resourcing of this unprecedented Initiative.\n\nThe White House mobilized Cabinet agencies and released a 60-page report that detailed the various problems young men and boys of color face as well as potential solutions for creating a cradle-to-college-and-career pipeline among that population, that disproportionately faces a prison pipeline. Last month, the White House announced that MBK had attracted $200 million in private funding for the effort.\n\nObama and civil rights advocates point to statistics that show that relative to their white counterparts, African American, Latino and Native American boys are more likely to live in low-income communities with high rates of crime, be raised by single mothers, and to attend poor-performing schools.\n\nAdministration officials insist that the initiative and data gathered will benefit both boys and girls, even as they stress that black and brown boys face particular obstacles that merit a targeted approach. Officials also have noted that the White House the Council on Women and Girls (CWG) encompasses women and girls of color.\n\nValerie Jarrett, head of the council sent this statement to She The People:\n\nSince day one of his Administration, President Obama has focused on increasing opportunity for women and girls, as part of his larger focus on expanding opportunity for each and every American. It\u2019s why \u2014 during his first days in office \u2014 he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which extends critical protections for all workers who may face pay discrimination, and it\u2019s why \u2014 during his first three months in office \u2014 he created the first-ever White House Council on Women and Girls, which for years has tackled issues that disproportionately affect women and girls of color, including equal pay and violence against women. It\u2019s also why his administration has built a long track record of taking actions that will help both girls and boys succeed, from improving early learning to creating a fair criminal justice system.\n\nBy every measure \u2014 health, education, jobs \u2014 black and brown girls and women lag behind their white counterparts. The women\u2019s letter points out that Latinas have the lowest graduation rate among all young women. Black women are three times as likely to go to prison as white women, and black girls are the fastest growing population of incarcerated youth. As well, black girls are suspended at much higher rates than girls of any other race and at a rate that is higher than most boys.\n\nOn twitter, critics of MBK have started the hashtag #WhyWeCantWait:\n\nA national convo about the uplift of the Blk community that does not include women and girls is not an honest conversation. #WhyWeCantWait\n\nThe letter writing and twitter campaign faults the White House for failing to require the MBK task force to report data on women and girls of color and suggests that the council on women and girls has neither the prominence, infrastructure nor financial backing to put it on the same footing as MBK.\n\n\u201cThis erasure simply adds to the crisis that girls of color face, forcing them to suffer in relative silence,\u201d the letter argues. \u201cIn short, women and girls of color are not doing fine, and until they are, men and boys will not be doing fine either.\u201d\n\nKimberle Williams Crenshaw, who is a law professor at UCLA and Columbia University and one of the organizers of the letter-writing campaign, said that some of the academics and activists who signed the letter registered their concerns with the White House and the nonprofit groups and private organizations involved in the initiative during the planning and fact finding stages.\n\nThe White House more recently reached out to the coalition of men who signed the first letter to set up an informational session on MBK. No date has been set for that meeting.\n\nIn a kind of dueling letter-writing campaign, the White House has also had some high-profile advocates express support for MBK. In a letter called \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper Is a Great Fathers\u2019 Day Gift for Our Children,\u201d posted on the Huffington Post Web site last Friday and signed by 40 black women, the head of a black women\u2019s policy group expressed surprise that \u201cthat there are some who believe that President Obama\u2019s My Brother\u2019s Keeper Initiative is too narrow because it does not focus on women and girls of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we fully agree that much work is needed to improve the lives of Black women and girls, we also know it is vitally important that the \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d Initiative stays focused on men and boys of color.

Visit Nailsea School here in southwestern England, and about the only skirts you'll see are those on teachers; most of the girls on campus are required to dress like the boys, in standard-issue trousers, after the school amended its uniform policy this year to become a skirt-free zone.\n\nIt's a new approach to an old problem: the fight against rising hemlines, a perennial battle that probably brings back embarrassing memories for the mothers of many of today's schoolgirls.\n\nNailsea belongs to a small but growing number of schools in\n\nthat have given up chastising students for hemline creep and instead resorted to what one commentator calls \"the nuclear option\": blacklisting skirts altogether.\n\nSharna Griffin isn't happy about it.\n\nSure, some of her peers have cast modesty a bit too far to one side. \"It is a bit of a problem, because we don't want to see their knickers. Walking up the stairs, you don't want to see whatever the girl's wearing under the skirt,\" the 15-year-old said.\n\nBut she thinks the ban smacks of collective punishment to students who obey the rules and don't let their regulation black skirts migrate much above the knee or disappear under their V-neck sweaters.\n\n\"I've never really been one to follow the crowd,\" Sharna said. \"I don't think it's fair that the girls whose skirts are the correct length will not be able to wear them.\"\n\nOn the first two days of school, she showed up in a skirt in protest, only to be sent home early.\n\nThe decision at Nailsea and other schools to forbid skirts springs from the exasperation of administrators and teachers, who were tired of spending precious time forcing students to correct wardrobe malfunctions instead of getting them to ponder the Norman Conquest.\n\nGirls who might've kissed their parents goodbye in the morning looking like paragons of virtue were arriving on campus with their skirts bunched up at the waist and drastically shortened. One headmaster in western England complained that his female students wore skirts that were \"almost like belts,\" while a headmaster in a Scottish border town warned that the girls' increasingly revealing attire risked encouraging \"inappropriate thoughts\" among the boys.\n\nBetter to establish an environment that focuses attention on learning, not legs, than to maintain the status quo for the sake of tradition, educators say.\n\nIn general, there is little debate in this country over obliging children to wear uniforms to school, unlike in the United States, where the matter often becomes the subject of a fierce argument over civil liberties and freedom of expression.\n\nMuch of the relaxed attitude here may simply be a function of how long school uniforms have been a fixture on the British cultural and academic landscape.\n\nBy some accounts, the world's first school uniform debuted in England about 450 years ago at Christ's Hospital, a school for needy boys. Pupils at the now-private (and expensive) institution still deck themselves out much as they did in Tudor times, in dark blue overcoats, breeches for boys, pleated skirts for girls, white neckerchiefs, yellow socks and leather belts.\n\nAlthough they resemble young seminarians, students voted overwhelmingly last year to keep their distinctive outfits rather than adopt any \"modern\" innovations.\n\nDisputes over uniforms in Britain therefore have more to do with their specifications, not their existence. For campuses that have nixed skirts, grumbling has mainly come from parents and girls who want to have a choice between trousers and skirts, not scrap regulations altogether.\n\nEducators say combating the rise of hemlines isn't about prudery but preventing the sexualization of children at ever-younger ages."], "summary": ["Thanks to the movies, Americans who have never set foot in this country have a fair idea of what  British  schoolchildren look like."]}, {"title": ["Viral GoldieBlox Video Ignites Legal Battle With Beastie Boys"], "text": ["Brands have been put on notice: You've got to fight, for your right, to go viral.\n\nEarlier this week, a toy company called GoldieBlox made an inspirational promotional video featuring a parody of the 1987 Beastie Boys hit \"Girls.\" The YouTube video quickly became a colossal viral marketing success, with more than 7.2 million views since Sunday.

It\u2019s one magazine I actually find time to read (as a working mother of three little boys, reading for fun does not make it high on my to-do list). But I have to say I am appalled by this content. Here is the official poll on the Vanity Fair web site: Poll: Which Animated Movie Character Was Drawn with the Most Sex Appeal? And here is a tweet from @VanityFair about this contest:\n\nIn a world where we constantly position women and girls as sex objects and expose girls to a plethora of inappropriate sexual images way too early in their lives, is this the kind of \u201cfun\u201d poll that a smart magazine like Vanity Fair should be supporting? I realize that they appeal to an adult audience. I also realize that this is not the first time they have content I think crosses the line between cool, fun, appropriate, and vulgar and inappropriate. I distinctly remember this cover because my six-year old asked me all kinds of questions I didn\u2019t think should even be in his little six-year old mind when he saw it:\n\nToo sexy for a magazine cover?\n\nSo, clearly, to toe the line with sexual content and innuendos is something Vanity Fair is OK doing, and probably because it sells more magazines. I would venture to bet that this type of cover sells many more issues than the cover with Meryl Streep on it in January of the same year. I understand that there is a need to be sensational, and I also know that Vanity Fair does pride itself on cover photography by topnotch photographers, artists in the world of photography, that can sometimes border on too sexually explicit. But I think they need to draw the line when dealing with a genre that is aimed at children. As an adult with kids, it offends me to have a poll sexualizing characters that are aimed at very young little girls and very young little boys. It almost has an icky \u201cpedophile vibe\u201d to be looking at these Disney characters and voting on which is the \u201csexiest.\u201d This is how Vanity Fair describes the poll:\n\nSo click on through to our poll\u2014which we\u2019ll update every few days for the next three weeks\u2014and tell us which G-rated animated character\u2014whether it be scrappy Tramp from Lady and the Tramp or poor, cheekboneless Snow White\u2014has the most PG-13 appeal\n\nAs an adult who has watched a lot of these movies with my little children, I don\u2019t want anything to do with this sort of poll. And I fear what a teenager who sees this poll thinks. We have to sexualize even the innocent cartoon characters that these kids grow up with (that I grew up with as well)? Vanity Fair even alludes to Snow White and the fact that she is \u201ccheekboneless.\u201d Seriously? Should she have plastic surgery? Be airbrushed like models are on covers to look sexier, with more sexually acceptable cheekbones? I guess the poll will soon tell us which Disney character more of us want to sleep with? Our kids are faced with enough overtly sexual content these days, can\u2019t anything be sacred? As it is the Disney Princess phenomena is hard for me to swallow.

For girls to rule, as they do in these shows, apparently boys and men must take over the airhead roles formerly reserved for female characters. Turnabout is fair play, though in \u201cBella\u201d that makes the humor fairly dumb and predictable.\n\nAnother thing we learn from \u201cBella\u201d is that girls, like boys, seem to find flatulence jokes hilarious; the first one comes less than nine minutes into the premiere. \u201cK. C. Undercover,\u201d a comedy that begins Sunday night on the Disney Channel, must be aimed at a slightly more sophisticated crowd; here the gas gag doesn\u2019t show up until 20 minutes in.\n\nK. C. (Zendaya) is a 16-year-old who discovers that her seemingly nondescript parents are secret agents. The show teaches us that what 16-year-old girls really, really want is to live in 1965, because once the parents take K. C. into their confidence and she becomes an agent herself, she enters a world full of goofy spy devices reminiscent of the shoe phone in \u201cGet Smart.\u201d\n\nThe humor here is zippier than in \u201cBella,\u201d because K. C. has a smart, quick mouth that calls to mind \u201cHannah Montana.\u201d In the premiere, she tries to ward off a room full of threatening figures by commanding: \u201cStand back.

C.\u2019s brother is pure goofball, and her father is the clueless-dad type.\n\nFathers, at least, get some redemption in \u201cOpen Heart,\u201d which begins Tuesday on TeenNick. There\u2019s no dumb comedy here; this is a drama, and it tells us something that the Nancy Drew franchise first proved 85 years ago: What girls really, really, really want is to be private investigators.\n\nDylan (Karis Cameron), another 16-year-old, seems to have a knack for getting into mild trouble, which lands her in a community service program at the hospital where her mother and sister are doctors. She has a lot on her mind: Her beloved father has recently vanished, and she doesn\u2019t buy the explanation that it was a simple case of abandonment.\n\nIt\u2019s a decently made, serious show, and flatulence-free in the premiere.

Bloomberg, for its practice of closing low-performing schools. Mr. de Blasio promised to infuse such schools with money and social services, with closing a last resort.\n\nThe mayor is now under pressure to show that schools are improving before he seeks re-election next year. While the Education Department has cited some progress in the 94 schools it has made its main focus, including increased graduation rates at most of the high schools in the group, enrollment at those schools is plummeting as families move their children elsewhere.\n\nDr. Wiltshire\u2019s potential departure is not the only indication that the city\u2019s strategy is running into difficulty. The New York Post reported on Sunday that Caterina Lafergola, the principal of Automotive High School, another school that the de Blasio administration has made a top priority, is leaving to become the principal of Baldwin High School on Long Island.\n\nBy the time Mr. de Blasio became mayor, Boys and Girls and Automotive had long been among the state\u2019s worst-performing high schools. With the state threatening to close the schools, the city made a deal with the teachers\u2019 union that required staff members to reapply for their jobs, and it named Dr. Wiltshire and Ms. Lafergola as the principals.\n\nDr. Wiltshire said in an interview on Tuesday that he had interviewed for a job as principal of Uniondale High School in Uniondale, N.Y., and that the district had expressed interest in him, but he had not decided what to do.\n\n\u201cMy focus now nine days before the end of the school year is to work as hard as I can to ensure the success\u201d of Medgar Evers and Boys and Girls, he said. \u201cAt the end of the year I will make whatever decision that I need to make.\u201d\n\nDr. Wiltshire\u2019s tenure at Boys and Girls was troubled from the start. Upon arriving, he began to encourage students who were lacking credits and at risk of not graduating to transfer. On Tuesday, he defended his actions, saying some students lagged so far behind that they had no chance of graduating before turning 21 and aging out of the school system, and that they could be better served at schools designed for such older students.\n\nDr. Wiltshire also clashed with a social services agency, Good Shepherd Services, that was supposed to provide support for students and their families, resulting in the agency\u2019s ending the partnership, according to a recent report in the education website Chalkbeat. Dr. Wiltshire denied that on Tuesday, saying he had \u201cno problem\u201d with Good Shepherd.\n\nDr. Wiltshire raised concerns among some Boys and Girls supporters early on when he proposed that it merge with Medgar Evers by having Medgar Evers move into Boys and Girls building.\n\nSome critics saw the proposal as a way to essentially phase out Boys and Girls, which has a larger, better-equipped building, while giving Medgar Evers, which occupies cramped quarters and does not have an auditorium or athletic fields, a better home.\n\nWhen the city did not support the merger proposal, Dr. Wiltshire suggested moving Medgar Evers into Boys and Girls\u2019 building without combining the two schools. But a committee of parents and faculty members at Medgar Evers recently informed the Education Department that they no longer supported the move.\n\nDr. Wiltshire said on Tuesday that he had made progress at Boys and Girls. The four-year graduation rate last year was 50 percent, up from 41.9 percent the previous year, according to the department, and Dr. Wiltshire said he expected it to be close to 60 percent this year. The department also said that student attendance had increased by nearly 2 percent this year compared with last year, and that teacher absenteeism had declined 22 percent from 2013-14 to 2014-15.\n\nAt the same time, enrollment at Boys and Girls under Dr. Wiltshire\u2019s leadership has declined by half, to 334 students.\n\nBoys and Girls has faced many challenges in its long history. By the mid-1980s, it had one of the highest dropout rates in the city and a reputation as a dangerous place. From 1986 to 2004 it experienced a resurgence under Frank Mickens, a principal who was a tough disciplinarian. The graduation rate increased \u2014 to 47.5 percent, from 24.4 percent \u2014 and enrollment reached a peak of 4,400 students in the 2005-6 school year.\n\nBut Mr. Mickens was accused of achieving that success in part by pushing out difficult students. In 2005, former students brought a class-action lawsuit against the Education Department, saying that they had been deprived of a fair chance at an education. In 2008, the parties reached a settlement under which the department agreed to give some students extra time to earn a diploma and others access to G.E.D. classes, counseling, tutoring and trade-school training.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Uniondale School District said that the district was interviewing candidates and had not made a choice yet. Chalkbeat reported on Tuesday that Dr. Wiltshire was considering taking the job in Uniondale.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on June 2, 2016, on page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Plan for School Revival Faces Possible Setback.

GoldieBlox upset the band after soundtracking one of its adverts with a parody version of their song Girls, reworking the original's sexist lyrics into a call-to-arms for more creative girls' toys.\n\nAfter receiving legal notification from the band's lawyers, however, the toy company has decided to remove the song from its advert. In a letter to the band, signed from \"Debbie and team GoldieBlox\", it states: \"We don't want to fight with you. We love you and we are actually huge fans. When we made our parody version of your song, Girls, we did it with the best of intentions. We wanted to take a song we weren't too proud of, and transform it into a powerful anthem for girls.\"\n\nThey continued: \"Our hearts sank last week when your lawyers called us with threats that we took very seriously. As a small company, we had no choice but to stand up for ourselves. We did so sincerely hoping we could come to a peaceful settlement with you.\"\n\nGoldieBlox's decision seems to have been determined by its discovery that late Beastie Boys member Adam Yauch requested in his will that the hip-hop group's music never be used in advertising: \"Although we believe our parody video falls under fair use, we would like to respect his wishes and yours.\"\n\nIt concludes: \"Since actions speak louder than words, we have already removed the song from our video. In addition, we are ready to stop the lawsuit as long as this means we will no longer be under threat from your legal team. We don't want to spend our time fighting legal battles. We want to inspire the next generation. We want to be good role models. And we want to be your friends.\"\n\nThe new advert makes use of an instrumental track instead."], "summary": ["Toy company remove its Beastie Boys parody song from an advert after receiving legal warnings from the band's lawyers, writes Tim Jonze"]}]
