[{"title": ["How international relations got religion, and got it wrong"], "text": ["This post is part of the \u201cIslam and International Order\u201d symposium.\n\nTwenty years ago, most scholars of international relations viewed religion as private and irrelevant to global politics. Today, that has profoundly changed. Everyone seems to be measuring, analyzing and alternately promoting and constraining religion in all manner of forms. Policymakers seek out representatives of moderate religion to create peaceable partnerships, while co-opting or sidelining their rivals. Scholars and advocacy networks model relations between religion and democracy, religion and peacebuilding, and religion and economic growth.\n\nThis new attention to religion is, at its base, predominantly about Islam. From 9/11 to the rise of the Islamic State, the \u201cproblem\u201d that Islam is said to represent has led to a moral panic in Western democracies.\n\nIslam is portrayed as the religion that is most recalcitrant and most resistant to Western-style modernity. It is seen as an agent that \u2014 like other religions, only more so \u2014 needs careful management to prevent it from igniting into violence.\n\nScholars and experts in the United States and abroad have built careers around reiterating the mantra that Islam must be reformed in the interest of world peace.\n\nIslam is also seen as its own potential solution, as long as moderation is institutionalized, extremists marginalized and the tradition\u2019s benevolent tendencies harnessed for the public good. \u201cGood\u201d forms of Islam are celebrated as sources of morality, community and discipline, while \u201cbad\u201d ones are criticized as the root of all global instability and insecurity. As Andrew Shyrock puts it, \u201cMuslims and particular forms of Islam are understood, with varying degrees of anxiety and affection, as problems that must be solved, or as solutions to problems.\u201d\n\nEfforts by scholars to engage with the public discourse surrounding Islam have proven frustrating. As Jillian Schwedler observed earlier this year, the perceived need to defend the \u201cmoderation\u201d of Islam in the public policy debate can leave scholars trapped within unsophisticated and corrosive categories. The sterility of debates such as whether inclusion of Islamists moderates them or whether the Islamic State is truly Islamic, led Schwedler to argue for the need to \u201cmake explicit the ways in which certain categories have dominated our analyses and think through whether or not there is more insight to be gained by refining or by abandoning them.\u201d The same stance should now be adopted by those engaged with the public arguments over religious freedom and calls to reform Islam.\n\nReligious freedom, particularly with regard to Islam, has evolved into a major policy arena. In the United States, this logic is institutionalized in the State Department\u2019s Office of International Religious Freedom and the Office of Religion and Global Affairs, with a supporting cast of nongovernmental initiatives, memos and conferences dedicated to supporting moderation, religious freedom, and toleration while countering violent extremism at home and abroad. The latter is especially prevalent since the rise of the Islamic State.\n\nLast week, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) introduced the Countering Violent Extremism Act to create a federal Office of Coordination for Countering Violent Extremism at the Department of Homeland Security. The bill defines violent extremism as \u201cideologically motivated terrorist activities.\u201d\n\nThis agenda is also intensifying in Canada and in Europe, reflecting a growing global consensus that extremist \u201cbad\u201d religion is the problem and moderate \u201cgood\u201d religion the solution. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced an increase in defense spending of nearly 4 billion euros between 2016 and 2020 to confront extremist threats at home and overseas. The European Parliament and the Canadian government have created offices\u2014such as the Canadian Office of International Religious Freedom and the European Parliament Intergroup on Freedom of Religion or Belief and Religious Tolerance \u2014 to conduct outreach to religious leaders, protect religious minorities, promote tolerant religion and counter extremism.\n\nThe problem is that the understanding of religion underlying these efforts is deeply flawed. Religion, law and politics have always intermingled \u2014 and it cannot be otherwise. As Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar argues in this series, religious interpretations are often an outcome of politics. Religion cannot be disembedded and isolated from the broader social and political fields in which it is entangled. It also cannot be divided between good and bad. There are no untouched religions waiting to be recovered from political irrelevance or reformed into peaceable governing partners.\n\nReligions, including Islam, do not cause violence. Nor do they cause peace. Religion is better understood as are other intersected categories such as gender, race and class: it is deeply enmeshed with legal forms of collective governance in complex and context-specific formations. The religious-secular opposition is itself unstable, shaped by social forces, institutions and practices that cannot be reduced to either of the two sides of the binary. Religion occupies different spaces under modern regimes of governance, some of which are often described as \u201csecular.\u201d\n\nMy new book, \u201cBeyond Religious Freedom,\u201d proposes a new vocabulary for the study of religion and governance. Distinguishing between \u201cexpert religion,\u201d \u201cofficial religion,\u201d and \u201clived religion,\u201d it disaggregates religion in order to access a richer field of religio-political realities. Taking Islam as an example, \u201clived\u201d Islam would refer to the practices of ordinary Muslims as they interact with religious authorities, rituals, texts and institutions as they seek to navigate and make sense of their lives, connections with others and place in the world. It identifies a diverse field of human activity, relations, investments and beliefs that may or may not be captured in the set of human goings-on identified as \u201cIslamic\u201d for the purposes of law and governance. \u201cGoverned\u201d or \u201cofficial\u201d Islam, on the other hand, is religion as construed by those in positions of political and religious power, including the state and various forms of law. Examples include the official Islam of state institutions \u2014 such as the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs, the Turkish Diyanet, the French foreign ministry, and the Egyptian state\u2014as well as the official Islams of various supranational institutions \u2014 including the International Criminal Court, the European Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\n\nFinally, \u201cexpert\u201d Islam refers to Islam as construed by those who generate knowledge about Islam including scholars, policy experts, religious authorities and government officials.\n\nDisaggregating Islam into these three categories reveals that expert and official construals of Islam do not and cannot exhaust the field of contemporary Muslim religiosities. Lived Islam does not align with an understanding of Islam as a singular, bounded cause of political behavior. It often diverges from Islam as construed by the Turkish, Egyptian, French, Saudi \u2014 or American \u2014 state. The practices and traditions of lived Islam often dissent from orthodox, elite or official understandings of what Islam is or should be.\n\nNeither \u201cIslam\u201d nor \u201cMuslim political actors\u201d are singular, agentive forces that can be analyzed, quantified, engaged, celebrated, condemned, or divided between good and bad. References to \u201cMuslim political behavior\u201d should be met with skepticism. To rely for policy purposes on the category of an Islamic actor or Islamic state, as does the U.S. initiative on Countering Violent Extremism, mistakenly presumes a form of actor-ship motivated by Islam. This is sociologically untenable.\n\nThere is no singular Islam, just as there is no single Christianity or Hinduism. As anthropologist Samuli Schielke explains, \u201cIslam, like any major faith, is not simply something \u2013 it is a part of people\u2019s lives, thoughts, acts, societies, histories and more. Consequently, it can be many different things \u2013 a moral idiom, a practice of self-care, a discursive tradition, an aesthetic sensibility, a political ideology, a mystical quest, a source of hope, a cause of anxiety, an identity, an enemy \u2013 you name it.\u201d\n\nSingling out Islam as a cause of political behavior and a platform for conducting foreign policy obscures the broader and always entangled economic, historical, geographic, political and religious contexts in which discrimination, violence and coexistence occur. We lose sight of the bigger picture. Social tensions and conflicts that have roots in multiple contributing factors are depoliticized, their causes explained away through reference to intolerant theologies.\n\nThe recent debate over whether the Islamic State is Islamic is one example. As Anver Emon explains, the moral panic surrounding the Islamic State arises out of a context in which the \u201cIslamic\u201d is being rendered as an ideology to respond to a broader history of political, economic and social frustration and dispossession. Emon posits: \u201csuppose instead of asking whether ISIS is Islamic, we were to say that ISIS is as much Islamic as it is a product of broken promises at the end of the British and French mandates; ISIS is as much Islamic as it is a product of the American interventions in Iraq; ISIS\u2019s brutality is as Islamic as the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s lynching of Black Americans was Christian, both Islam and Christianity having been used to justify violent brutality.\u201d\n\nDisaggregating religion highlights the gaps between the constructs of religious governance \u2014 such as religious freedom, religious outreach and interfaith dialogue \u2014 authorized by experts, states and other authorities, and the lived experiences of the individuals and communities they aspire to govern.\n\nDifferentiating between expert, governed and lived religion also highlights a dangerous trend of tying \u201cexpert religion\u201d to state power in the age of the so-called war on extremism.\n\nToday, on a scale not seen since the height of the Cold War, expert religion is being mobilized in the service of governed religion \u2014 and the aims of the state. A new partnership between the State Department and the American Academy of Religion (AAR), for example, announces that State is \u201ckeenly interested in drawing upon the insight of scholars of religion to help formulate and implement US foreign policy. In support of this vital effort, \u2026 [t]hese fellowships provide a wonderful opportunity to offer your expertise toward reducing violent conflict, improving regional security and protecting human rights.\u201d\n\nExperts who study religion have an important role to play in educating students and informing the public. Informed public engagement and writing on these issues is critical inside Washington and beyond. However, there is an important distinction to be made here. Peddling scholarly wares in the service of the state is not equivalent to writing and speaking in an effort to inform public debates. The former, as in the AAR-State partnership, inevitably involves pressing that power\u2019s case. The latter, as in Schwedler\u2019s analysis mentioned earlier, does not. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs, Charles King wrote that \u201cdemocratic societies depend on having a cadre of informed professionals outside government\u2014people in universities, think tanks, museums, and research institutes who cultivate expertise protected from the pressures of the state.\u201d Nowhere is restraint, reflection and understanding protected from the immediate interests of the state more urgently needed today than at the intersection of religion and global politics.\n\nFrom academic institutions to government bureaucracies, our understandings of law, politics, history and more need to pay careful attention to religion, but it cannot be imagined as a variable, or as an agent segregated from other dimensions of human sociality.\n\nBureaucracies do not need independent offices predicated on the notion that religions are entities set apart from the world requiring special treatment. To presume that religion is a stable category of law and governance decreases our capacity to understand complex conflicts. It favors forms of religion authorized by those in power, and it excludes other ways of being and belonging.\n\nElizabeth Shakman Hurd is an associate professor of politics at Northwestern University. Her forthcoming book, \u201cBeyond Religious Freedom: The New Global Politics of Religion,\u201d (Princeton University Press, 2015) examines how state-sponsored initiatives including international religious freedom advocacy, development assistance and nation building, and international law codify and restrict religion."], "summary": ["Religions, including Islam, do not cause violence.

Religion is better understood as are other intersected categories such as gender, race and class."]}, {"title": ["Europe's Problem Is Race, Not Islam"], "text": ["Racism has existed in all countries ever since the invention of the scapegoat. There will probably always be racists. The solution is not to paw through the minds of every citizen, searching for the least little ember of racism, but to prevent racists from putting their nauseating ideas into words, from claiming their \u201cright\u201d to be racists, to express their hatred.\n\nIn France, racist speech was largely set free by Nicolas Sarkozy and the issue he made of national identity. When the highest authority of the state stands up in front of assholes and bastards and tells them, \u201cLet \u2019er rip, boys,\u201d what do you think the assholes and bastards are going to do? They\u2019re going to start saying publicly what, up till then, they had limited themselves to belching out at the drunken conclusion of family dinners. Racist speech, which our institutions, politicians and intellectuals had succeeded in confining to the zone between the xenophobe\u2019s teeth and his kitchen door, made its way out into the street, flooded the media and further befouled the plumbing of social networks.\n\nYes, we are witnessing a renaissance of racist outbursts, yet the term \u201cracism\u201d is only used timidly these days. The term \u201cracism\u201d is quite simply in the process of being superseded by \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d\n\nWhen a veiled woman is harassed and assaulted because she is veiled in the Muslim fashion (the elusive aggressor generally being described as a skinhead), the anti-Islamophobe champions the victim as a representative of Islam. Not because she is a citizen who happens to have been singled out by a fascist for her beliefs. For her champion, the sin lies in the fact that she has been attacked not as a citizen who has the right to dress as she likes, but as a Muslim woman. The real victim is Islam. God has thus been placed well above his believer, but when the latter is harmed, God is the intended target. This is what the anti-Islamophobic activist finds truly unacceptable.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why anti-Islamophobes have not chosen to call themselves \u201canti-Muslimophobes.\u201d They consider the Muslims they defend to be merely the instruments of God.\n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where you might get the impression that foreigners or citizens of foreign extraction are assaulted in France solely for being Muslims. Victims of racism who are of Indian, Asian, Roma, black African or Caribbean descent may soon need to find themselves a religion if they wish to be protected.\n\nMinority pressure group activists who seek to impose the concept of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d on judicial and political authorities have only one goal: to persuade the victims of racism to proclaim themselves Muslim. Forgive me, but the fact that racists may also be Islamophobic is essentially incidental. They are racists first, and merely use Islam to target their intended victim: the foreigner or person of foreign extraction. By taking only the racist\u2019s Islamophobia into account, we minimize the danger of his racism. Yesterday\u2019s anti-racism activist is turning into the salesman of a highly specialized commodity: a niche form of discrimination.\n\nThe fight against racism is a fight against all forms of racism; but what is the fight against Islamophobia against? Is it against criticizing a religion or against abhorring its practitioners because they are of foreign descent? Racists have a field day when we debate whether it is racist to say the Koran is a useless rag. If tomorrow the Muslims of France were to convert to Catholicism or renounce all religion, it wouldn\u2019t make the least bit of difference to the racists\u2014they would continue to hold these foreigners or French citizens of foreign descent responsible for every affliction.\n\nOkay, so Mouloud and G\u00e9rard are Muslims. Mouloud is of North African extraction and comes from a Muslim family; G\u00e9rard is of European origin and comes from a Catholic family. G\u00e9rard has converted to Islam. Both are trying to rent the same apartment. Assuming they have similar incomes, which of the two Muslims is more likely to get the apartment? The Arab-looking fellow or the white guy? It\u2019s not the Muslim who will be turned away; it\u2019s the Arab. The fact that the Arab bears no outward sign of belonging to the Muslim faith changes nothing. Yet what does the anti-Islamophobia activist do? He charges religious discrimination instead of decrying racism\u2026.\n\nSocial discrimination, while the subject of much less debate than religious discrimination because it is manifested more insidiously and discreetly, is nevertheless far more predominant in France. Managers choose their future employees less on the basis of their religious membership, true or supposed, than, for instance, on their place of residence. Between the Mouloud who lives in upscale Neuilly-sur-Seine and the Mouloud who lives in the down-at-heel banlieue of Argenteuil, which of the two, assuming they are of equal competence, is more likely to get the job? Yet who ever talks about this kind of discrimination? People are massively discriminated against based on their social class, but since a large proportion of the poor\u2014whom no one wants hanging around their place of work, their neighborhood, or their building\u2014is made up of people of foreign descent and, among these, a great many of Muslim origin, the Islamic activist will claim that the problem is Islamophobia.\n\nExcerpted from the book OPEN LETTER by St\u00e9phane Charbonnier.

She is the founder of Islamwich and a contributor to On Islam and Aquila Style. A version of this piece first appeared on CNN iReport.\n\n(CNN) -- I am a Muslim, but I wasn't always. I converted to Islam in November 2001, two months after 9/11.\n\nI was 21 and living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It was a bad time to be a Muslim. But after four years of studying, poking and prodding at world religions and their adherents, I decided to take the plunge.\n\nI am the product of a Creole Catholic and an Irish atheist. I grew up Catholic, then was agnostic, now I'm Muslim.\n\nMy journey to Islam began when I was about 15 years old in Mass and had questions about my faith. The answers from teachers and clergymen -- don't worry your pretty little head about it -- didn't satisfy me.\n\nSo I did what any red-blooded American would do: the opposite. I worried about it. For many years. I questioned the nature of religion, man and the universe.\n\nAfter questioning everything I was taught to be true and digging through rhetoric, history and dogma, I found out about this strange thing called Islam. I learned that Islam is neither a culture nor a cult, nor could it be represented by one part of the world. I came to realize Islam is a world religion that teaches tolerance, justice and honor and promotes patience, modesty and balance.\n\nAs I studied the faith, I was surprised many of the tenants resonated with me. I was pleased to find that Islam teaches its adherents to honor all prophets, from Moses to Jesus to Mohammed, all of whom taught mankind to worship one God and to conduct ourselves with higher purpose.\n\nI was drawn to Islam's appeal to intellect and heartened by the prophet Mohammed's quote, \"The acquisition of knowledge is compulsory for every Muslim, whether male or female.\"\n\nI was astounded that science and rationality were embraced by Muslim thinkers such as Al-Khawarizmi, who invented algebra; Ibn Firnas, who developed the mechanics of flight before Leonardo DaVinci; and Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, who is the father of modern surgery.\n\nHere was a religion telling me to seek out answers and use my intellect to question the world around me.\n\nIt was 2001, and I had been putting off converting for a while. I feared what people would think but was utterly miserable. When 9/11 happened, the actions of the hijackers horrified me. But in its aftermath, I spent most of my time defending Muslims and their religion to people who were all too eager to paint a group of 1.6 billion people with one brush because of the actions of a few.\n\nI was done being held hostage by the opinions of others. In defending Islam, I got over my fear and decided to join my brothers and sisters in the faith I believed in.\n\nMy family did not understand, but it wasn't a surprise to them since I had been studying religion. Most were very concerned for my safety. Luckily, most of my friends were cool about it, and even curious to learn more.\n\nThese days, I am a proud wearer of hijab. You can call it a scarf. My scarf does not tie my hands behind my back, and it is not a tool of oppression. It doesn't prevent thoughts from entering my head and leaving my mouth. But I didn't always know this.\n\nStudying Islam didn't immediately dispel all my cultural misconceptions. I had been raised on imagery of women in the East being treated like chattel by men who forced them to cover their bodies out of shame or a sense of ownership.\n\nBut when I asked a Muslim woman \"Why do you wear that?\", her answer was obvious and appealing: \"To please God. To be recognized as a woman who is to be respected and not harassed. So that I can protect myself from the male gaze.\"\n\nSurprisingly, Islam turned out to be the religion that appealed to my feminist ideals.Theresa Corbin\n\nShe explained how dressing modestly is a symbol to the world that a woman's body is not meant for mass consumption or critique.\n\nI still wasn't convinced and replied, \"Yeah, but women are like second class citizens in your faith?\"\n\nThe very patient Muslim lady explained that, during a time when the Western world treated women like property, Islam taught that men and women were equal in the eyes of God. Islam made the woman's consent to marriage mandatory and gave women the opportunity to inherit, own property, run businesses and participate in government.\n\nShe listed right after right that women in Islam held nearly 1,250 years before women's lib was ever thought of in the West. Surprisingly, Islam turned out to be the religion that appealed to my feminist ideals.\n\nIt might shock you to know that I had an arranged marriage. That doesn't mean I was forced to marry my father's first choice suitor, like Jasmine from \"Aladdin.\" Dad didn't even have a say.\n\nWhen I converted, it wasn't a good time to be a Muslim. Feeling isolated, alienated and rejected by my own society pushed me to want to start a family of my own. Even before converting, I had always wanted a serious relationship but found few men looking for the same.\n\nAs a new Muslim, I knew there was a better way to look for love and a lifelong partnership. I decided that if I wanted a serious relationship, it was time to get serious about finding one. I wanted an arranged marriage.\n\nI made a list of \"30 Rock\"-style deal breakers. I searched. I interviewed. I interrogated friends and families of prospects.\n\nI decided I wanted to marry another convert, someone who had been where I was and wanted to go where I wanted to go. Thanks to parents of friends, I found my now-husband, a convert to Islam, in Mobile, Alabama, two hours from my New Orleans home. Twelve years later, we are living happily ever after.\n\nNot every Muslim finds a mate in this manner, and I didn't always see this for my life. But I am glad Islam afforded me this option.\n\nLiving in a post-9/11 world\n\nI never had to give up my personality, American identity or culture to be a Muslim. I have, at times, had to give up on being treated with dignity.\n\nI have been spat on, had eggs thrown at me and been cursed at from passing cars. And I have felt terror when the mosque I attended in Savannah, Georgia, was first shot at, then burned down.\n\nIn August 2012, I moved back home to New Orleans, where being different is the norm. I finally felt safe -- for a while. But now, with the continuous news coverage of the un-Islamic group known as ISIS, I have been subjected to much of the same treatment I received in other cities.

However Pakistan is riven with sectarian hate, and many even consider the 15% of the population who are shia as kaafirs. The shia are blasted regularly around the country. Since Ismailis are part of the shia, in that sense they are also killed by the true believers among the Sunnis.

But I doubt it is for religous reasons. They come done even harder on islamists than on these apostates. Summary executions and life imprisonments is a norm for muslim brotherhood activists.

The fact of the matter is that there is no Dhimmism around these days.\n\nThere was no rejection of the UDHR by muslim delegates. The current UDHR is based upon Judeo-Christian Principles. There is nothing wrong with muslim countries demanding that their sensibilities also be taken into account just as those of Jews and Christians. In a democratic system there is nothing wrong in demanding your rights. If the majority of UN feels that this demand is unjustified I believe the muslims would move on.

The \"Abrahamic faiths\" aren't quite the same, especially in their view of Abraham.\n\nWhile Christianity accepts the Torah as the Old Testament and just says a new word came through Jesus, Islam claims something else. They rewrote both books, saying Christianity and Judaism lied about Abraham, Moses, Jesus and much of the rest of the books.\n\nIslam has a very different interpretation and it can't be lumped in the same category as Judaism and Christianity.\n\nBoth Islam and Judaism (and, thus, Christianity) are considered \"Abrahamic faiths,\" in that they stem from a connection to Abraham as described in the Torah, the Bible, and the Qu'ran. Since Islam is predominantly an Arabic religion, it has been concluded that Islam stems from Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham and half-brother of Isaac father of Jacob (later named Israel).\n\nThe following verses from Quran proves the point ....\n\nAnd He(Allah) taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: \"Tell me the names of these if ye are right.\" ( Quran,Al-Baqara, Chapter #2, Verse #31)\n\nAllah did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of 'Imran above all people,- ( Quran,Aal-e-Imran, Chapter #3, Verse #33)\n\nWe(Allah) have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. ( Quran,An-Nisa, Chapter #4, Verse #163)\n\nAnd remember We(Allah) took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant: ( Quran,Al-Ahzab, Chapter #33, Verse #7)\n\nThe only \"ignorance\" here is Christians trying to disown Islam as a part of their intolerant common Abrahamic \"my-way-or-the highway\" denominator.\n\nPosted by: coloradodog | January 27, 2010 11:05 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nHirsi Ali says it well: ************* http://www.aei.org/article/100627 Nowhere in the world is bigotry so rampant as in Muslim countries. No difference is greater between American and Islamic principles than the founding ideals of both. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of Islam that al-Qa'ida and other Muslim puritans insist on the implementation of sharia law, jihad and the eternal subjection of women. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of America that blacks and women fought for--and gained--equal rights and gays and new immigrants continue to do so.\n\nI would include Thomas Jefferson's improvements on the New Testament. The king, the sheik and the ayatollah have the authority to rule that parts of the Koran no longer apply in the modern world. For instance, the edicts of sharia law that reject scientific inquiry and order all Muslims to spread Islam.\n\nAnd of course, no reading selection would be complete without a copy of the US Constitution, highlighting (because you can do that in a Kindle) the Eighth Amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAnd for good measure, I would also add John F.Kennedy's inaugural address: \"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. . . . To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required. . . . To those nations who would make themselves our adversary . . . we dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. . . . Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\" Not to mention woman.\n\nI wish he [Obama] would host a reading summit where we truly \"say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts that too often are said only behind closed doors\".

Sadly, he shows that statistics is another area of ignorance.As the main body of people hating Jews today is the Muslim World, his initial presence falls flat on its face.\n\nSadly, though, Patel's main problem isn't ignorance, it's intentional propaganda, his usual tool. Go to the link he gives for the poll. Look at the chart on page 7. The responders seem to dislike Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism at around the same percentage. Yes, Christianity is in the mix. Muslims, on the other had, are disliked at a much higher rate.\n\nCould it be because Jihad declared a war on the West and Muslims have been killing and trying to kill us for decades? No, says Patel, it's because we also hate Jews. Sorry, doesn't follow.\n\nOn page eight, they switch from the religions to people who follow the religion. The pattern remains. There's a major statistical difference between dislike of Muslims and the other religious adherents.\n\nOn page 13, the study tries to link the prejudice against Jews with that against Muslims. Notice a religion disappears: Buddhism. Gosh, could it be that fundamentalist Christians dislike ALL other religions? It would seem reasonable, but since the apologist group behind the study wants to create a specific link, that aspect is not discussed.\n\nFinally, notice the point about Americans not knowing about Islam. That's true. What the creators of the apologia miss is that helps them. For instance, a lot of Americans claim Muslims want peace while the group claims most Muslims want equality. However, the Organization of the Islamic Conferences, representing fifty-seven Muslim nations, openly rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and unanimously proposed The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. That claims that the only rights that exist are the ones Muslims grant people through Sharia law.\n\nThat is not equality, that is not peaceful, that is reality -- A reality neither Patel nor the folks who massaged the polls want people to see.\n\nPosted by: groucho42 | January 27, 2010 1:38 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nIslam is a gutter 'religion' that promotes death, violence, and the subjugation of women.\n\nPosted by: tjhall1 | January 27, 2010 1:25 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\n\u00c2\u00abPeople who hate Jews also hate Muslims.\u00c2\u00bb Posted by Eboo Patel | January 25, 2010; 9:28 AM ET\n\nO Eboo, *some* people who hate Jews also hate Muslims.

There were people involved in those acts who felt God & Jesus were blessing their actions, but you didn't see the entire population jump up and say \"Doing this is God's will.\"\n\nWorld War One did not occur because of Christ, it occurred because a Serbian nationalist/irredentist/whatever-ist shot the Archduke Ferdinand. That in and of itself didn't cause the war - indeed, the upper circles of the Austrian government didn't exactly mourn the Archduke's passing. However, elements within the government saw an excellent excuse to engage in a war to destroy Serbia. That, and a mishmash of entangling alliances in Europe, led to a succession of declaration of wars when Austria went to war. Those were hardly the only factors involved - nationalism, unresolved territorial disputes, arms races, etc., all contributed as well. There was very little overt religious reasoning.\n\nThe nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not conducted because the Japanese weren't Christians. They were conducted because an invasion of the Home Islands ('mainland' Japan) had casualty estimates - for the Allies alone - ranging from the hundreds of thousands to the MILLIONS. Using the bombs would only put a few bomber crews and their fighter escorts at risk; and it was hoped that obliterating one or two cities would shock the Emperor into surrendering before the bloodbath of an invasion became necessary. Personally, I agree with Truman's decision to use atomic weapons.\n\nHolding all Christians responsible for such events would be like holding all Muslims responsible for the cowards who strap bombs to their chests and blow up unarmed civilians.

Muslims and Jews are very strongly monotheistic while Christians believe in a three pronged God. The central figure in Christianity is the God-Man figure of Jesus. Ask any Jew or Muslim if they believe that Jesus was God in human flesh who ran afoul of the authorities and was executed. They will most emphatically say that Jesus was a man and not a God. This is diametrically opposed to the central believ of Christianity. Each religion thinks it is the true one and that the others are misguided or downright false.

Indeed the new comer has paid the green-back dollars to acquire or rent that property but this fact is often overlooked. Old is gold, so think the older residents. The New may be Platinum for all you know. I don't care - that attitude is a road block in beginning a communication. One wonders why the friendly instinct of welcoming a new neighbour takes a back seat these days when you and I need it most. COMPASSION The youth is driven by Passion. If there is a sweet little chick in the new flock, the boys of nubile age think of dating her - not with the intention of taking her to altar but with the not so sacred instinct of taking her to bed sooner or later. That is not the human spirit. That is the animal instinct. We all behave as animals sometime or the other. It is the correct education that purifies and reforms our baser instincts and makes a man out of an animal. MANURBHAV The Vedas, most ancient scriptures in the library of mankind advise all men and women to be good Human Beings.Among the many qualities of a Human Being isCompassion or in Sanskrit, KARUNA. If my heart bleeds for the man or the woman next door when she needs help, I have risen to the status of a Human after sublimating my animal instincts. I have risen higher than what the old saying demanded of me. A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED - that is the age-old adage. Going to the help of a neighbour, a fellow man, even before making friends with him or her is a step higher than what was required of me, a neighbour, in the saying on friendship.Going into that direction further, one may even go to rescue a damsel in distress and that would indeed be an act of a good human being. One need not be a Knight in shining armor on a white horse to prove to the humanity his Humane qualities. This may be done in a lane or a bylane where the poor, the needy and the deprived men and women live. Let us obey the Vedic injunction \"MANURBHAV'and be true to our Dharma or the code of conduct to live and let live in a human society.God treats all human beings as His sons and daughters and does not differentiate between votaries of one religion and another. ______________________________ UPVANOM, 609, Sector 29, NOIDA - 201303, INDIA.

The Christians at one time had their own version of the Taliban. They were known as Crusaders. Before they became involved fighting Muslims, they hunted down and killed other Christians who they viewed as heretics. Many people cloak themselves in religion in order to justify their evil deeds. One of my more infamous ancestors coined the phrase, \"Kill them all - Let God sort them out,\" when he ordered the massacre of the entire population of a French town because he had heard that there were some heretics living in the town. Motivations have always seemed to be the same, e.g., power, wealth, and women, although I have no doubt that some cult leaders are criminally insane. Charismatic leaders always seem to draw in followers, many of whom seem to welcome religion as an excuse to abuse other people, and others who are misquided into thinking that they will reap great rewards in the hereafter.\n\nPosted by: FredinVicksburg | January 27, 2010 3:12 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nYassirYousufi: \"Kafir is a Ayyan Hirsi Ali Inspired Hindu whacko masquerading as a muslim apostate because he thinks it sounds cool to be an apostate and no body will be able to guess his true identity!\"\n\nI may be a vulcun or a klingon or even a 10 foot Navi.

In the case of Jews and Muslims, the conflict stems from each group having an entitlement agenda that is fundamentally incompatible with the other.\n\nThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that every individual who identifies themselves as a Muslim or a Jew necessarily subscribes to the group agenda. It just means that for Jews who do, they believe that their religious/ethnic identity entitles them to take possession of Israel/Palestine to the dispossession of others.\n\nFor Muslims, it is the entitlement to see that their religion is the predominant faith everywhere. It is the resistance to those agendas that engenders hatred and fuels conflict. The Muslims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agenda is much more comprehensive and is therefore perceived to be the greater threat to the world at large. Beyond that, there is the content of Islamic scripture, which features justification for many draconian social restrictions and sanctions.\n\nI would probably be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause if they were not wedded to a to a religious tradition that takes its intolerance seriously. Zionism is sort of like affirmative action to aid a group that has suffered much and could really use a safe haven.

We are at war with the Jihadist who in my opinion are the true believers of the words of the Quran, and are the one who reflect the ideology of Islam in its pure form. It is okay to hate those who kill because their ideology tells them to kill kaafirs. I have no desire to tolerate an Abdul Muttalib who wanted to kill the hundreds flying on that plane.

The facts are relatively straightforward compared to 9/11. If it could be shown that the anthrax attacks originated from the US government or agents thereof, it would produce a massive shift in the public's thinking.

Actually, this is making the problem of Islamic terrorism worse.\n\nOf course, people who happen to be born into a muslim family like Eboo Patel (or Yasseryousufi) will have the need to defend Islam because it is a part of their identity. Most people are good people. Most muslims are good people. But their are too many violent muslims today and throughout history. Good muslims are good in spite of the supremacist and narrow-minded ideology found in the Koran and Hadith. The good find the good in the Koran and ignore the bad, which is nice. The problem is there is too much justification for acts of violence against nonbelievers (kafirs) in the Koran and in the culture & history of Islam. This has to be addressed and cannot be ignored. step 1: ackowledge there is a problem. step 2: try to fix the problem.\n\nWe seem to be stuck on step 1 with the \"Rodney King\" approach. Please try to tell the Al Queda, Taliban & suicide bombers that \"we must reject hate\". Good Luck. Sadly, step 2 will also be a problem. If a few things in the Koran need to changed, can it be done? No. The Koran says many nice things, but it also says some bad and violent things regarding women & nonbelievers.

They are not in the same league.\n\nIt is a fatally false assumption that prejudice, per se, is a bad thing. We are prejudiced against Nazis, against white racists, against black racists, against Communists, against Ku Klux Klan members -- and everyone thinks that is perfectly o.k. And, it is o.k.!!! It is always o.k. to be prejudiced against members of a group and adherents of an ideology whose values are inimical to ours. Not only is it o.k.; but it is morally right. In the case of Islam, it is clear that Islamic values are inimical to ours. One need only read the Koran, the sayings of Muhammad, Sharia law and the writings of the great Islamic religious authorities, the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. When a person says that he/she is Moslem, it is reasonable to infer that this person accepts and promotes the doctrines of Islam which are based on violent religious bigotry toward all non-Moslems. Now, we know that there are many Moslems who do NOT favor those Islamic doctrines. They exist -- just like there were many members of the Nazi party and the Soviet Communist party who did not support the doctrines of those parties. The problem is: how do we know in advance which members of the group truly support the doctrines of the group? We cannot know in advance. That is where prejudice comes in. ALL members of a subversive group should be under suspicion of supporting the doctrines of that group -- until proven otherwise. Failure to exercise proper prejudice and suspicion has already cost us thousands of innocent lives -- think 9/11, Ft. Hood, the London bombing, the Madrid bombing, the Bali bombing, the Mumbai massacre, and so on and so on. Prejudice against members of a group, based on knowledge of the principles of the group, is perfectly reasonable. Let us work to educate Americans so that the percentage of those prejudiced against Moslems will increase! Those Moslems who do not share the violent religious bigotry of Islam can help us be being vocal about their rejection of those parts of the Koran, Hadith and Sharia which promote violent religious bigotry. Reasonable prejudice is a matter of life and death. It is elementary self-defense.\n\nPosted by: Montedoro | January 26, 2010 7:52 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nWell EP is trying to be egalitarian.

How many times have we seen reports of Imams spouting hatred from the pulpits of the world and nothing is done to stop them?

All religions seem to be opposed to the truly open society. The relative simplicity of Islamic theology--its greater rationality, if I might somewhat abuse the term, compared with, say, trinitarianism--supports a totalitarian vision of theocracy. Divinely led authorities can, of course, never be wrong. (Contrast this view with that of the Founders, who understood that people are fallible and that factions are corrupt and set ambition to check ambition, and created institutional checks to the assumption of total power.) With the recent report that al Qaeda is determined on a MWD attack in the US, it seems that al Qaeda is bent on an apocalyptic confrontation between Islam and the modern world.\n\nI would only point out that in the wake of a large-scale attack on the US, it would loom large in the thinking of whatever militant group eventually came to power that Meccans and Tehranis don't vote in American elections. Also that it is probably a lot easier to break a country than to take it over. There is a lot of anger in the US right now, and another big attack could easily result in a tea-party-type President committed to a fundamentalist apocalypticism.

Throughout the MIddle East, Asia, and parts of Africa antisemitism is part of the official discourse, present in local and state-run newspapers, television shows, in films, including the notorious Rothchild nonsense. The Protocols is standard fare.\n\nThe ranting against Christians both inside mosques and without, the oppression, the violence in Pakistan, Egypt, etc., is also everywhere present.\n\nNo rabbi would last two minutes if he began spouting hate from the \"pulpit\" against any group on the face of the earth. It may not be. It would be considered a defilement.\n\nWhen Muslims the world over take that same position, dialogue could open. Unfortunately, those who attempt it are often the victims of oppression, occasionally serious.\n\nIn the meantime, Eboo, I would be interested in knowing your thoughts about the displacement, forced exile of the remaining Jews of Yemen.\n\nI can also tell you this. I loathe bigotry with every fiber that comprises my being. HOwever, I long ago recognized that one does not fight fire with a cup of water. For Jews, the house is always on fire or about to be burned.\n\nFrance will be Judenrein in my lifetime. Jews are slowly leaving England. Why is that Eboo? Let's be friends would be great.

The single highest predictor of prejudice against Muslims is prejudice against Jews.\n\nLet's make this as personal as possible. When someone in your synagogue says something ugly about Muslims, know that he is marshaling the forces of anti-Semitism. When someone in your mosque speaks hatefully about Jews, know that he is putting your Muslim children more at risk.\n\nFor the purposes of prejudice, the terms 'dirty Muslim' and 'dirty Jew' are virtually interchangeable.

However Pakistan is riven with sectarian hate, and many even consider the 15% of the population who are shia as kaafirs. The shia are blasted regularly around the country. Since Ismailis are part of the shia, in that sense they are also killed by the true believers among the Sunnis. However, Agha Khan, the Imam of the Ismailis is accorded state honors and welcomed as a muslim by the Pakisan Government, the OIC, the Saudi Monarchy, etc.\n\nPosted by: AKafir | January 28, 2010 1:57 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nDo you doubt the figure i quoted?

But I doubt it is for religous reasons. They come done even harder on islamists than on these apostates. Summary executions and life imprisonments is a norm for muslim brotherhood activists. Islam has already declared that there is no compulsion in religion!\n\nI can speak for Pakistan, we consider Ismailis and Ahmedis as apostates. They are a recognized minority and are present in influential Government positions. The Christians are free to build their Churches, carry out their religous practice freely, they have job quotas and reserved seats in the parliament which is in addition to what they can get on their own.\n\nYour hatefilled rant speaks volumes of your ignorance. Dhimmism used to be practiced during middle ages. During that time the Christian Crusaders used to kill all muslim prisoners in any territory they occupied and even ate those people (Ma'arrat al-Numan!). I found Dhimmism to be a just system, but thats a debate for another day. The fact of the matter is that there is no Dhimmism around these days.\n\nThere was no rejection of the UDHR by muslim delegates. The current UDHR is based upon Judeo-Christian Principles. There is nothing wrong with muslim countries demanding that their sensibilities also be taken into account just as those of Jews and Christians. In a democratic system there is nothing wrong in demanding your rights. If the majority of UN feels that this demand is unjustified I believe the muslims would move on. But there's nothing wrong in asking is it?\n\nSo how many muslim countries have you been to? You make pretty stupid generalising statements about status of minorities.

The \"Abrahamic faiths\" aren't quite the same, especially in their view of Abraham.\n\nWhile Christianity accepts the Torah as the Old Testament and just says a new word came through Jesus, Islam claims something else. They rewrote both books, saying Christianity and Judaism lied about Abraham, Moses, Jesus and much of the rest of the books.\n\nIslam has a very different interpretation and it can't be lumped in the same category as Judaism and Christianity.\n\nBoth Islam and Judaism (and, thus, Christianity) are considered \"Abrahamic faiths,\" in that they stem from a connection to Abraham as described in the Torah, the Bible, and the Qu'ran. Since Islam is predominantly an Arabic religion, it has been concluded that Islam stems from Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham and half-brother of Isaac father of Jacob (later named Israel).\n\nThe following verses from Quran proves the point ....\n\nAnd He(Allah) taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: \"Tell me the names of these if ye are right.\" ( Quran,Al-Baqara, Chapter #2, Verse #31)\n\nAllah did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of 'Imran above all people,- ( Quran,Aal-e-Imran, Chapter #3, Verse #33)\n\nWe(Allah) have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. ( Quran,An-Nisa, Chapter #4, Verse #163)\n\nAnd remember We(Allah) took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant: ( Quran,Al-Ahzab, Chapter #33, Verse #7)\n\nThe only \"ignorance\" here is Christians trying to disown Islam as a part of their intolerant common Abrahamic \"my-way-or-the highway\" denominator.\n\nPosted by: coloradodog | January 27, 2010 11:05 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nHirsi Ali says it well: ************* http://www.aei.org/article/100627 Nowhere in the world is bigotry so rampant as in Muslim countries. No difference is greater between American and Islamic principles than the founding ideals of both. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of Islam that al-Qa'ida and other Muslim puritans insist on the implementation of sharia law, jihad and the eternal subjection of women. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of America that blacks and women fought for--and gained--equal rights and gays and new immigrants continue to do so.\n\nI would include Thomas Jefferson's improvements on the New Testament. The king, the sheik and the ayatollah have the authority to rule that parts of the Koran no longer apply in the modern world. For instance, the edicts of sharia law that reject scientific inquiry and order all Muslims to spread Islam.\n\nAnd of course, no reading selection would be complete without a copy of the US Constitution, highlighting (because you can do that in a Kindle) the Eighth Amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAnd for good measure, I would also add John F.Kennedy's inaugural address: \"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. . . . To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required. . . . To those nations who would make themselves our adversary . . . we dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. . . . Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\" Not to mention woman.\n\nI wish he [Obama] would host a reading summit where we truly \"say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts that too often are said only behind closed doors\".

Infidels under Muslim rule are ritually and legally mistreated in the name of Allah by Sharia law. Muslims have proudly documented the long history of such Dhimmitude and they were the ones who first made Jews wear yellow symbols of identification on clothing, long before Germany did.\n\nIslam has three ordered choices it offers conquered infidels: Conversion, acceptance of Dhimmi status and death. Is it any real wonder why many of the indigenous people conquered by Jihad accepted conversion in order to escape the later two choices?\n\nThat also goes back to one of my original points. There's no such thing a \"moderate Islamic countries\" when all unanimously reject the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and support The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam.

Sadly, he shows that statistics is another area of ignorance.As the main body of people hating Jews today is the Muslim World, his initial presence falls flat on its face.\n\nSadly, though, Patel's main problem isn't ignorance, it's intentional propaganda, his usual tool. Go to the link he gives for the poll. Look at the chart on page 7. The responders seem to dislike Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism at around the same percentage. Yes, Christianity is in the mix. Muslims, on the other had, are disliked at a much higher rate.\n\nCould it be because Jihad declared a war on the West and Muslims have been killing and trying to kill us for decades? No, says Patel, it's because we also hate Jews. Sorry, doesn't follow.\n\nOn page eight, they switch from the religions to people who follow the religion. The pattern remains. There's a major statistical difference between dislike of Muslims and the other religious adherents.\n\nOn page 13, the study tries to link the prejudice against Jews with that against Muslims. Notice a religion disappears: Buddhism. Gosh, could it be that fundamentalist Christians dislike ALL other religions? It would seem reasonable, but since the apologist group behind the study wants to create a specific link, that aspect is not discussed.\n\nFinally, notice the point about Americans not knowing about Islam. That's true. What the creators of the apologia miss is that helps them. For instance, a lot of Americans claim Muslims want peace while the group claims most Muslims want equality. However, the Organization of the Islamic Conferences, representing fifty-seven Muslim nations, openly rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and unanimously proposed The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. That claims that the only rights that exist are the ones Muslims grant people through Sharia law.\n\nThat is not equality, that is not peaceful, that is reality -- A reality neither Patel nor the folks who massaged the polls want people to see.\n\nPosted by: groucho42 | January 27, 2010 1:38 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nIslam is a gutter 'religion' that promotes death, violence, and the subjugation of women.\n\nPosted by: tjhall1 | January 27, 2010 1:25 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\n\u00c2\u00abPeople who hate Jews also hate Muslims.\u00c2\u00bb Posted by Eboo Patel | January 25, 2010; 9:28 AM ET\n\nO Eboo, *some* people who hate Jews also hate Muslims.

However, elements within the government saw an excellent excuse to engage in a war to destroy Serbia. That, and a mishmash of entangling alliances in Europe, led to a succession of declaration of wars when Austria went to war. Those were hardly the only factors involved - nationalism, unresolved territorial disputes, arms races, etc., all contributed as well. There was very little overt religious reasoning.\n\nThe nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not conducted because the Japanese weren't Christians. They were conducted because an invasion of the Home Islands ('mainland' Japan) had casualty estimates - for the Allies alone - ranging from the hundreds of thousands to the MILLIONS. Using the bombs would only put a few bomber crews and their fighter escorts at risk; and it was hoped that obliterating one or two cities would shock the Emperor into surrendering before the bloodbath of an invasion became necessary. Personally, I agree with Truman's decision to use atomic weapons.\n\nHolding all Christians responsible for such events would be like holding all Muslims responsible for the cowards who strap bombs to their chests and blow up unarmed civilians. Do people do it? Yes. Is it right? No.\n\nPosted by: SeaTigr | January 27, 2010 11:54 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nBy the way a Muslim country Turkey, the Ottoman empire was part of WWI - if you are going to defend Islam as peaceful know your history - the Turks committed atrocities against the christian people under their thumb for hundreds of years.\n\nIts called Prima Noctura - rape the christian bride on her wedding night - if we want to talk history its going to get worse and worse.\n\nPosted by: agapn9 | January 27, 2010 11:52 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nMuslims have a very aggressive culture.

Muslims and Jews are very strongly monotheistic while Christians believe in a three pronged God. The central figure in Christianity is the God-Man figure of Jesus. Ask any Jew or Muslim if they believe that Jesus was God in human flesh who ran afoul of the authorities and was executed. They will most emphatically say that Jesus was a man and not a God. This is diametrically opposed to the central believ of Christianity. Each religion thinks it is the true one and that the others are misguided or downright false. The other major religions (Hinduism for example) have an entirely different idea of God. Let's stop repeating the nonsense that we all worship the same God.

The koran CLEARLY states that all religions should be respected. Jews think that they are suffering...ok lets flip the numbers than. We will kill one jew for each palestinian that has died. Do you honestly think that the numbers of jews killed to the numbers of palestinians is even remotely close? Im not talking about the holocaust, im talking about israel vs palestine. Please stop reading the koran if all your going to do is translate it the wrong way. Israel will always be mad about the holocaust. well guess what, who cares?

Now that they do, they are causing trouble throughout the region which was once much more stable, before the ww2.

Indeed the new comer has paid the green-back dollars to acquire or rent that property but this fact is often overlooked. Old is gold, so think the older residents. The New may be Platinum for all you know. I don't care - that attitude is a road block in beginning a communication. One wonders why the friendly instinct of welcoming a new neighbour takes a back seat these days when you and I need it most. COMPASSION The youth is driven by Passion. If there is a sweet little chick in the new flock, the boys of nubile age think of dating her - not with the intention of taking her to altar but with the not so sacred instinct of taking her to bed sooner or later. That is not the human spirit. That is the animal instinct. We all behave as animals sometime or the other. It is the correct education that purifies and reforms our baser instincts and makes a man out of an animal. MANURBHAV The Vedas, most ancient scriptures in the library of mankind advise all men and women to be good Human Beings.Among the many qualities of a Human Being isCompassion or in Sanskrit, KARUNA. If my heart bleeds for the man or the woman next door when she needs help, I have risen to the status of a Human after sublimating my animal instincts. I have risen higher than what the old saying demanded of me. A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED - that is the age-old adage. Going to the help of a neighbour, a fellow man, even before making friends with him or her is a step higher than what was required of me, a neighbour, in the saying on friendship.Going into that direction further, one may even go to rescue a damsel in distress and that would indeed be an act of a good human being. One need not be a Knight in shining armor on a white horse to prove to the humanity his Humane qualities. This may be done in a lane or a bylane where the poor, the needy and the deprived men and women live. Let us obey the Vedic injunction \"MANURBHAV'and be true to our Dharma or the code of conduct to live and let live in a human society.God treats all human beings as His sons and daughters and does not differentiate between votaries of one religion and another. ______________________________ UPVANOM, 609, Sector 29, NOIDA - 201303, INDIA.

That ideology has mass murderers (Osama Bin Laden), ordinary murderers (abortion doctor killers and those who deprive sick children of medical care) and garden variety haters (Pat Robertson and his ilk). Only rarely do mainstream religious leaders fight back or even condemn this evil. They do not do so because under the hood of every religious belief in the world is the theological notion that \"I am right. I know God's will and you are therefore wrong.\" Fundamentalism assaulted will yield religion destroyed is the unspoken fear. So the great churches sit in silence.

Before they became involved fighting Muslims, they hunted down and killed other Christians who they viewed as heretics. Many people cloak themselves in religion in order to justify their evil deeds. One of my more infamous ancestors coined the phrase, \"Kill them all - Let God sort them out,\" when he ordered the massacre of the entire population of a French town because he had heard that there were some heretics living in the town. Motivations have always seemed to be the same, e.g., power, wealth, and women, although I have no doubt that some cult leaders are criminally insane.

In the case of Jews and Muslims, the conflict stems from each group having an entitlement agenda that is fundamentally incompatible with the other.\n\nThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that every individual who identifies themselves as a Muslim or a Jew necessarily subscribes to the group agenda. It just means that for Jews who do, they believe that their religious/ethnic identity entitles them to take possession of Israel/Palestine to the dispossession of others.\n\nFor Muslims, it is the entitlement to see that their religion is the predominant faith everywhere. It is the resistance to those agendas that engenders hatred and fuels conflict. The Muslims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agenda is much more comprehensive and is therefore perceived to be the greater threat to the world at large. Beyond that, there is the content of Islamic scripture, which features justification for many draconian social restrictions and sanctions.\n\nI would probably be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause if they were not wedded to a to a religious tradition that takes its intolerance seriously. Zionism is sort of like affirmative action to aid a group that has suffered much and could really use a safe haven.

Anti-semitism is hatred of a \"people\", of real people who can get hurt. The equivalent would be hatred of muslims, and around the world the non-muslims bend over backword to show that their cultures and their ideologies do not even discriminate against muslims. This is opposed to the deeply deeply biased and discriminatory laws on the books of all Islamic countries against the non-muslims.\n\nI am an apostate of Islam and I think it is justified to criticize and expose the hatred against the Kaafir that is imbedded in Islam. Hating Islam is hating an ideology. It is okay to hate Nazism. It is okay to hate Islam. It is not okay to generalize that to the people, the muslims. We are at war with the Jihadist who in my opinion are the true believers of the words of the Quran, and are the one who reflect the ideology of Islam in its pure form. It is okay to hate those who kill because their ideology tells them to kill kaafirs. I have no desire to tolerate an Abdul Muttalib who wanted to kill the hundreds flying on that plane. What ever ideology drove him to want to kill those people should be hated. He says that that ideology is Islam.

The facts are relatively straightforward compared to 9/11. If it could be shown that the anthrax attacks originated from the US government or agents thereof, it would produce a massive shift in the public's thinking. People would then be forced to accept the fact that they have been lied to and the country was attacked through an inside job.

Actually, this is making the problem of Islamic terrorism worse.\n\nOf course, people who happen to be born into a muslim family like Eboo Patel (or Yasseryousufi) will have the need to defend Islam because it is a part of their identity. Most people are good people. Most muslims are good people. But their are too many violent muslims today and throughout history. Good muslims are good in spite of the supremacist and narrow-minded ideology found in the Koran and Hadith. The good find the good in the Koran and ignore the bad, which is nice. The problem is there is too much justification for acts of violence against nonbelievers (kafirs) in the Koran and in the culture & history of Islam. This has to be addressed and cannot be ignored. step 1: ackowledge there is a problem. step 2: try to fix the problem.\n\nWe seem to be stuck on step 1 with the \"Rodney King\" approach. Please try to tell the Al Queda, Taliban & suicide bombers that \"we must reject hate\". Good Luck. Sadly, step 2 will also be a problem. If a few things in the Koran need to changed, can it be done? No. The Koran says many nice things, but it also says some bad and violent things regarding women & nonbelievers. Some religions allow for discussion and evolution; others are the rigid word of God and cannot be questioned (Islam & Christianity).\n\nSo, thanks for the nice thoughts, but some of us are trying to cause real change and progress, even if its unpleasant.\n\nPosted by: clearthinking1 | January 26, 2010 9:45 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nPrejudice against Muslims and prejudice against Jews are not the same thing. They are not in the same league.\n\nIt is a fatally false assumption that prejudice, per se, is a bad thing. We are prejudiced against Nazis, against white racists, against black racists, against Communists, against Ku Klux Klan members -- and everyone thinks that is perfectly o.k. And, it is o.k.!!! It is always o.k. to be prejudiced against members of a group and adherents of an ideology whose values are inimical to ours. Not only is it o.k.; but it is morally right. In the case of Islam, it is clear that Islamic values are inimical to ours. One need only read the Koran, the sayings of Muhammad, Sharia law and the writings of the great Islamic religious authorities, the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. When a person says that he/she is Moslem, it is reasonable to infer that this person accepts and promotes the doctrines of Islam which are based on violent religious bigotry toward all non-Moslems. Now, we know that there are many Moslems who do NOT favor those Islamic doctrines. They exist -- just like there were many members of the Nazi party and the Soviet Communist party who did not support the doctrines of those parties. The problem is: how do we know in advance which members of the group truly support the doctrines of the group? We cannot know in advance. That is where prejudice comes in. ALL members of a subversive group should be under suspicion of supporting the doctrines of that group -- until proven otherwise. Failure to exercise proper prejudice and suspicion has already cost us thousands of innocent lives -- think 9/11, Ft. Hood, the London bombing, the Madrid bombing, the Bali bombing, the Mumbai massacre, and so on and so on. Prejudice against members of a group, based on knowledge of the principles of the group, is perfectly reasonable. Let us work to educate Americans so that the percentage of those prejudiced against Moslems will increase! Those Moslems who do not share the violent religious bigotry of Islam can help us be being vocal about their rejection of those parts of the Koran, Hadith and Sharia which promote violent religious bigotry. Reasonable prejudice is a matter of life and death. It is elementary self-defense.\n\nPosted by: Montedoro | January 26, 2010 7:52 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nWell EP is trying to be egalitarian.

And anyone who justifies their hate with religion commits a double evil.\n\nNo religion advocates hate. Rather, all religions advocate respect, compassion, generosity, and love towards others. That includes Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.\n\nWhile it is true that some have done evil in the name of Islam, that is not truly Islam. And while some have done evil in the name of Judaism, that is not truly Judaism. Likewise, while some have done evil in the name of Christianity, that is not truly Christianity.\n\nWe must get past the fear and ignorance that breeds hate. We must reject hate. We must embrace those of all religions (and those of no religion) with respect and compassion.\n\nAnd we must not resort to religious bias to avoid dealing with the very real political/social/environmental problems that are the source of the estrangement between peoples and religions.

How many times have we seen reports of Imams spouting hatred from the pulpits of the world and nothing is done to stop them?

All religions seem to be opposed to the truly open society. The relative simplicity of Islamic theology--its greater rationality, if I might somewhat abuse the term, compared with, say, trinitarianism--supports a totalitarian vision of theocracy. Divinely led authorities can, of course, never be wrong. (Contrast this view with that of the Founders, who understood that people are fallible and that factions are corrupt and set ambition to check ambition, and created institutional checks to the assumption of total power.) With the recent report that al Qaeda is determined on a MWD attack in the US, it seems that al Qaeda is bent on an apocalyptic confrontation between Islam and the modern world.\n\nI would only point out that in the wake of a large-scale attack on the US, it would loom large in the thinking of whatever militant group eventually came to power that Meccans and Tehranis don't vote in American elections. Also that it is probably a lot easier to break a country than to take it over. There is a lot of anger in the US right now, and another big attack could easily result in a tea-party-type President committed to a fundamentalist apocalypticism. What would be the domestic cost to such a President of striking out against Muslim countries? Zippo, I submit. The fulminating anti-semitism of the Muslim world is not a good sign.

The Protocols is standard fare.\n\nThe ranting against Christians both inside mosques and without, the oppression, the violence in Pakistan, Egypt, etc., is also everywhere present.\n\nNo rabbi would last two minutes if he began spouting hate from the \"pulpit\" against any group on the face of the earth. It may not be. It would be considered a defilement.\n\nWhen Muslims the world over take that same position, dialogue could open. Unfortunately, those who attempt it are often the victims of oppression, occasionally serious.\n\nIn the meantime, Eboo, I would be interested in knowing your thoughts about the displacement, forced exile of the remaining Jews of Yemen.\n\nI can also tell you this. I loathe bigotry with every fiber that comprises my being. HOwever, I long ago recognized that one does not fight fire with a cup of water. For Jews, the house is always on fire or about to be burned.\n\nFrance will be Judenrein in my lifetime. Jews are slowly leaving England. Why is that Eboo? Let's be friends would be great.

Civilians are fleeing in panic because these ISIS savages are known to slaughter innocent people.\n\nMeantime, Turkish tanks and troops do nothing; sitting on their side of the border watching the carnage unfold. Turkey is a Muslim country and all throughout the world, there are about 1.6 billion Muslims and 35 countries practice some kind of Sharia Law. That means they are governed by people who abide by principles of Islam that are controversial to say the least. In some places you can even be stoned to death for committing a sin.\n\nA study published by the Pew Research Center last year asked Muslims if they favor Sharia Law. In Afghanistan 99 percent do; Pakistan 84 percent; Iraq 91 percent; Egypt 74 percent; Jordan 71 percent. And even in Great Britain, a national opinion poll found that 78 percent of British Muslims believe people who criticize Mohammed should be prosecuted by civil authorities.\n\nSo you can see that millions of Muslims think their religion should dictate what happens in society. Enter uber liberals Bill Maher and Ben Affleck. Mr. Maher is anti-religionist. He despises all organized religion; makes no secret of that.\n\nMr. Affleck is a traditional liberal, a fervent supporter of President Obama and of many left wing causes.\n\nOver the weekend Mr. Maher, an author named Sam Harris and Mr. Affleck debated Islam.\n\nMAHER: All I'm saying is that liberal principles like freedom of speech, freedom to practice any religion you want without fear of violence, freedom to leave a religion, equality for women, equality for minorities, including homosexuals -- these are liberal principles that liberals applaud for but then when you say in the Muslim world this is what is lacking, then they get upset.\n\nSAM HARRIS, AUTHOR: Yes, yes well, liberals have really failed on the topic of theocracy. They'll criticize white theocracy, they'll criticize Christians. They'll still get agitated over the abortion clinic bombing that happened in 1984 but when you want to talk about the treatment of women and homosexuals and free thinkers and public intellectuals in the Muslim world, I would argue that liberals have failed us.\n\nAFFLECK: So hold on are you the person who understands the officially codified doctrine of Islam? You are the interpreter of that?\n\nHARRIS: I'm actually well-educated on this topic.\n\nAFFLECK: I'm asking you. You are saying if I criticize that you're saying that Islamaphobia is not a real thing. That if you're critical of something --\n\nMAHER: Well it's not a real thing when we do it.\n\nMAHER: Well no it really is.\n\nHARRIS: I'm not denying that certain people are bigoted against Muslims as people. And that's a problem.\n\nMAHER: Right big of you have.\n\nMAHER: But why are you hostile about this concept.\n\nAFFLECK: That's gross. It's racist.\n\nMAHERS: It's not, but it's so not. Your shifty Jew.\n\nMAHER: You're not listening what we are saying.\n\nHARRIS: We have to be able to criticize bad ideas.\n\nMAHER: Of course we do.\n\nAFFLECK: Ok, ok, but --\n\nHARRIS: But Islam is the mother load of bad ideas.\n\nAFFLECK: So we have ideas like blasphemy.\n\nO'REILLY: Interesting how Mr. Affleck invokes the name of Jesus. Now who is correct? As far as condemning all Muslims, Mr. Affleck is on the side of the angels, pardon the pun. As \"Talking Points\" stated last week most Muslims are peaceful people. Even if they do believe in Sharia Law, that's a flaw in their thinking, it doesn't mean they are violent maniacs.\n\nAlso like the bible there are violent passages in the Koran, it doesn't mean much. Interpretation of scripture is what separates a fair person from a hateful fanatic. However, Mr. Maher is correct on the overall effect Islam is having on the world right now. The truth is many Muslim nations have not confronted Islamic terrorism have not attacked violence in the name of Allah, and have not even condemned the jihad. There is exception to the rule but they are few.\n\nTherefore militant Islam continues to drive worldwide terrorism and have plenty of sanctuaries from which to commit their evil. Ben Affleck should well understand that he himself would be beheaded in a heartbeat by these ISIS animals and that even though they are the most extreme element of the jihad they are not that far away from their fanatical cousins.\n\nYou may remember that hours after America was attacked by al Qaeda on 9/11 thousands of Muslims, regular folks celebrated in the streets. They were happy that more than 3,000 innocent people, including Muslims, were murdered. Again, these people are a minority but they were not called out in any official way by Muslim nations around the world.\n\nThe truth is that Islamic jihad could not, could not exist if not for Muslim nations turning away. Turkey could crush ISIS right this minute, but Turkey does nothing. The Afghan people could turn against the Taliban, they do not. The Pakistani government harbored Osama bin Laden -- the government did. Those facts are something that Ben Affleck and others who agree with him should think about. In any discussion about the overall effect Islam is having on the world.\n\n\"Talking Points\" well understands that for centuries Muslims coexisted peacefully with other religions. But now terrorism and the jihadists are again on the move. And most Muslim nations are not joining with the West to confront that therefore, criticism of Islam's role on the world stage is certainly valid. The Muslim world needs to take a hard look at itself.\n\n- You can catch Bill O'Reilly's \"Talking Points Memo\" weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. ET on the Fox News Channel and any time on foxnews.com/oreilly.

With some 1.5 billion followers and rising, Islam's influence may be growing even faster than its numbers as the Arab Spring topples long-reigning secular rulers and opens the way to religiously inspired political parties.\n\nThe case against TLC\u2019s \u201cAll-American Muslim\u201d\n\nBut while there's no doubt about the importance of Islam, experts have different theories about why Muslims appear to be more religious than members of other global faiths - and contrasting views on whether to fear the depth of Muslims' commitment to their faith.\n\nOne explanation lies in current affairs, says Azyumardi Azra, an expert on Islam in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim majority country.\n\nMany Muslims increasingly define themselves in contrast with what they see as the Christian West, says Azra, the director of the graduate school at the State Islamic University in Jakarta.\n\n\"When they confront the West that they perceive or misperceive as morally in decline, many Muslims feel that Islam is the best way of life. Islam for them is the only salvation,\" he says.\n\nThe case for TLC\u2019s \u201cAll-American Muslim\u201d\n\nThat feeling has become stronger since the September 11 attacks, as many Muslims believe there is a \"growing conflict between Islam and the so-called West,\" he says.\n\n\"Unfortunately this growing attachment to Islam among Muslims in general has been used and abused by literal-minded Muslims and the jihadists for their own purposes,\" he says.\n\nBut other experts say that deep religious commitment doesn't necessarily lead to violence.\n\n\"Being more religious doesn't necessarily mean that they will become suicide bombers,\" says Ed Husain, a former radical Islamist who is now a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nIn fact, Husain argues that religious upbringing \"could be an antidote\" to radicalism.\n\nAmerican Muslim women who cover explain their choice\n\nThe people most likely to become Islamist radicals, he says, are those who were raised without a religious education and came to Islam later, as \"born-agains.\"\n\nMuslims raised with a grounding in their religion are better able to resist the distortions of Islam peddled by recruiters to radical causes, some experts like Husain argue, making them less likely to turn to violence.\n\nBut he agrees that Muslims are strongly attached to their faith, and says the reason lies in the religion itself.\n\n\"Muslims have this mindset that we alone possess the final truth,\" Husain says.\n\nMuslims believe \"Jews and Christians went before us and Mohammed was the last prophet,\" says Husain, whose book \"The Islamist\" chronicles his experiences with radicals. \"Our prophet aimed to nullify the message of the previous prophets.\"\n\nThe depth of the Muslim commitment to Islam is not only a matter of theology and current events, but of education and history, as well, other experts say.\n\n\"Where religion is linked into the state institutions, where religion is deeply ingrained from childhood, you are getting this feeling that 'My way is the only way,'\" says Fiyaz Mughal, the director of Faith Matters, a conflict-resolution organization in London.\n\nThe Ipsos-Mori survey results included two countries with a strong link between religion and the state: Legally Muslim Saudi Arabia, which calls itself the guardian of Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina; and Indonesia, home of the world's largest Muslim population.\n\nThe third majority Muslim country in the study is Turkey, which has a very different relationship with religion. It was founded after World War I as a legally secular country. But despite generations of trying to separate mosque and state, Turkey is now governed by an Islam-inspired party, the AKP.\n\nTurkey's experience shows how difficult it can be to untangle government and religion in Muslim majority countries and helps explain the Muslim commitment to their religion, says Azyumardi Azra, the Indonesia expert.\n\nHe notes that there has been no \"Enlightenment\" in Islam as there was in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, weakening the link between church and state in many Christian countries.\n\n\"Muslim communities have never experienced intense secularization that took place in Europe and the West in general,\" says Azra. \"So Islam is still adhered to very strongly.\"\n\nBut it's not only the link between mosque and state in many Muslim majority countries that ties followers to their faith, says professor Akbar Ahmed, a former Pakistani diplomat who has written a book about Islam around the world.\n\nLike Christians who wear \"What Would Jesus Do?\" bracelets, many Muslims feel a deep personal connection to the founder of their faith, the prophet Muhammad, he says.\n\nMuhammad isn't simply a historical figure to them, but rather a personal inspiration to hundreds of millions of people around the world today.\n\n\"When a Muslim is fasting or is asked to give charity or behave in a certain way, he is constantly reminded of the example set by the prophet many centuries ago,\" argues Ahmed, the author of \"Journey Into Islam: The Crisis of Globalization.\"\n\nHis book is based on interviews with Muslims around the world, and one thing he found wherever he traveled was admiration for Muhammad.\n\n\"One of the questions was, 'Who is your role model?' From Morocco to Indonesia, it was the prophet, the prophet, the prophet,\" says Ahmed, the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at American University in Washington.\n\nBut while Ahmed sees similar patterns across the Islamic world, Ed Husain, the former radical, said it was important to understand its diversity, as well.\n\n\"There is no monolithic religiosity - Muslims in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are following different versions of Islam,\" says Husain. \"All we're seeing (in the survey) is an adherence to a faith.\"\n\nPolitical scientist Farid Senzai, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding in Washington, raised questions about the survey's findings.\n\n\"Look at the countries that are surveyed - Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Turkey,\" he says. \"There are about 300 million Muslims in those three countries, (who make up) about 20% of Muslims globally.\"\n\nIslam is \"incredibly important\" in Saudi Arabia, he says.\n\n\"But in Tunisia or Morocco you could have had a different result. It would have been nice if they had picked a few more Arab countries and had a bit more diversity,\" says Senzai.\n\nThe pollster, Ipsos-Mori, does monthly surveys in 24 countries, three of which are majority Muslim \u2013 Turkey, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. The other countries range from India to the United States, and Mexico to South Korea, and are the same each month, regardless of the subject the pollsters are investigating.\n\nIn the survey released in July, about six in 10 Muslims in the survey said their religion was the only way to salvation, while only a quarter of Hindus and two out of 10 Christians made that claim about their own faiths.\n\nMore than nine out of 10 Muslims said their faith was important in their lives, while the figure was 86% for Hindus and 66% for Christians.\n\nIpsos-Mori surveyed 18,473 adults via an online panel in April and released the findings in July. Results were weighted to make the results as representative as possible, but the pollster cautioned that because the survey was conducted online, it was harder to get representative results in poorer countries where internet access is not widespread.\n\nCNN polling director Keating Holland also warns that in an \"opt-in\" survey, where respondents actively choose to participate, results tend to come from \"people who are confident in their opinions and express them openly... not good for intensely private matters like faith or income or sex.\"\n\nOnline surveys in countries that are not entirely free are also open to the possibility that pollsters get \"the approved response\" in those nations, \"where the people who are most likely to be willing to talk about such matters are the ones who hold, or at least verbalize, opinions that won't get them in trouble if they are expressed,\" Holland says.\n\nThat may have been an issue in Saudi Arabia, where respondents were given the choice of not answering questions on religion due to their potential sensitivity in the kingdom. The Saudi sample was the smallest, with 354 participants, meaning \"findings for Saudi Arabia must be treated with caution,\" Ipsos-Mori said.\n\nAbout 1,000 people participated in most countries, but sample sizes were smaller in the three majority Muslim countries and in eight other countries.\n\nThe survey participants did not reflect the true percentage of Christians and Muslims in the world. Christians were over-represented \u2013 as were people who said they had no religion \u2013 and Muslims were under-represented.\n\nNearly half the respondents identified themselves as Christian. Eleven percent were Muslim, 4% were Buddhist, 3% were Hindu and 3% were \"other.\" A quarter said they had no religion and 6% refused to say.\n\nFiyaz Mughal, the interfaith expert, argues that even though the countries surveyed might not be representative of the entire Muslim world, the findings about Muslims rang broadly true. Muslims in different countries were committed to their faith for different reasons, he says.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia is an institutionally religious state. Indonesia has religion tied into its culture,\" says Mughal.\n\nBut Muslim immigrants to Europe also show strong ties to their religion, either as a defense mechanism in the face of a perceived threat, or because of an effort to cling to identity, he contends.\n\nHe detects a link between insular communities and commitment to faith regardless of what religion is involved. It is prevalent in Muslim Saudi Arabia, but he has seen it among Israeli Jews as well, he says.\n\n\"The Israeli Jewish perspective is that (the dispute with the Palestinians) is a conflict of land and religion which are integrally linked,\" Mughal says.\n\n\"What does play a role in that scenario is a sense of isolationism and seclusion in Israeli Jewish religious communities, a growing trend to say, 'Our way is the only way,'\" he says.\n\nReligious leaders of all faiths need to combat those kinds of attitudes because of the greater diversity people encounter in the world today, he argues.\n\nThey have a responsibility to teach their congregations \"that if they are following a religion, it is not as brutal or exclusive as possible,\" Mughal says. \"Things are changing. The world is a different place from what it was even 20 years ago.\"\n\nPoliticians, too, \"need to take these issues quite seriously,\" he says.\n\n\"In the Middle East there are countries - the Saudi Arabias - where you need to be saying that diversity, while it may not be a part of the country, is something they have to deal with when moving in a globalized area,\" he says.\n\nBut Senzai, the political scientist, says that it's also important for the West to take the Muslim world on its own terms.\n\n\"Many Muslims want religion to play a role in politics,\" he says. \"To assume that everyone around the world wants to be like the West - that they want liberal secular democracy - is an absurd idea.\"\n\n\u2013 CNN's Nima Elbagir and Atika Shubert contributed to this report."], "summary": ["By Richard Allen Greene, CNN (CNN) -- Every religion has its true believers and its doubters, its pious and its pragmatists, but new evidence suggests that Muslims tend to be more committed to their faith than other believers."]}, {"title": ["These Paris Attacks Are Not About Religion"], "text": ["Another horrendous act of terrorism has taken place and people like myself who are on media speed-dial under \u201cCelebrity Muslims\u201d are thrust in the spotlight to angrily condemn, disavow, and explain\u2014again\u2014how these barbaric acts are in no way related to Islam.\n\nFor me, religion\u2014no matter which one\u2014is ultimately about people wanting to live humble, moral lives that create a harmonious community and promote tolerance and friendship with those outside the religious community. Any religious rules should be in service of this goal. The Islam I learned and practice does just that.\n\nViolence committed in the name of religion is never about religion\u2014it\u2019s ultimately about money. The 1976 movie, All the President\u2019s Men, got it right when it reduced the Daedalus maze of the Watergate scandal to the simple phrase, \u201cFollow the money.\u201d Forget the goons who actually carry out these deadly acts, they are nothing more than automated drones remote-controlled by others. Instead of radio signals, their pilots use selective dogma to manipulate their actions. They pervert the Qur\u2019an through omission and false interpretation.\n\nHow is it about money? When one looks at the goal of these terrorist attacks, it\u2019s clearly not about scaring us into changing our behavior. The Twin Tower attacks of 9/11 didn\u2019t frighten America into embracing Islam. The fatwa against Salman Rushdie didn\u2019t prevent the publication of The Satanic Verses. Like all terrorist attacks on the West, they just strengthen our defiant resolve. So the attack in Paris, as with most others, isn\u2019t about changing Western behavior, it\u2019s about swaggering into a room, flexing a muscle, and hoping to elicit some admiring sighs. In this case, the sighs are more recruits and more donations to keep their organization alive. They have to keep proving they are more relevant than their competing terrorist groups. It\u2019s just business.\n\nNor should we blame America\u2019s foreign policy as the spark that lights the fuse. Poverty, political oppression, systemic corruption, lack of education, lack of critical thinking, and general hopelessness in these countries is the spark. Yes, we\u2019ve made mistakes that will be used to justify recruiting new drones. But we shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves that the recent report detailing our extensive and apparently ineffective use of torture caused any kind of mass terrorist volunteers. The world knew we tortured. The only thing the report revealed was how bad we were at it. More important, if recruits were swayed by logical idealism, they would realize that the fact that we conducted, released, and debated such a report is what makes America admirable. We don\u2019t always do the right thing, but we strive to. We admit our faults and make adjustments. It may be glacial, but it\u2019s movement forward.\n\nKnowing that these terrorist attacks are not about religion, we have to reach a point where we stop bringing Islam into these discussions. I know we aren\u2019t there yet because much of the Western population doesn\u2019t understand the Islamic religion. All they see are brutal beheadings, kidnappings of young girls, bloody massacres of children at schools, and these random shootings. Naturally, they are frightened when they hear the word Muslim or see someone in traditional Muslim clothing. Despite any charitable impulses, they also have to be thinking, \u201cBetter safe than sorry\u201d\u2014as they hurry in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen the Ku Klux Klan burn a cross in a black family\u2019s yard, prominent Christians aren\u2019t required to explain how these aren\u2019t really Christian acts. Most people already realize that the KKK doesn\u2019t represent Christian teachings. That\u2019s what I and other Muslims long for\u2014the day when these terrorists praising the Prophet Muhammad or Allah\u2019s name as they debase their actual teachings are instantly recognized as thugs disguising themselves as Muslims. It\u2019s like bank robbers wearing masks of presidents; we don\u2019t really think Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush hit the Bank of America during their down time.\n\nWe can\u2019t end terrorism any more than we can end crime in general. Ironically, terrorism is actually an act against the very religion they claim to believe in. It\u2019s an acknowledgement that the religion and its teachings aren\u2019t enough to convince people to follow it. Any religion that requires coercion is not about the community, but about the leaders wanting power.\n\nI look forward to the day when an act of terrorism by self-proclaimed Muslims will be universally dismissed as nothing more than a criminal attack of a thuggish political organization wearing an ill-fitting Muslim mask. To get to that point, we will need to teach our communities what the real beliefs of Islam are.

Ali: Killing like that can never be justified. It\u2019s unbelievable. I could never support hurting innocent men, women and children. Islam is a religion of peace. It does not promote terrorism or killing people.\n\nBingham: Muslims are supposed to be responsible for this. How does that make you feel? Ali: People say a Muslim caused this destruction. I am angry that the world sees a certain group of Islam followers who caused this destruction, but they are not real Muslims. They are racist fanatics who call themselves Muslims, permitting this murder of thousands.\n\nBingham: When you became a Muslim, the religion was perceived as anti-white. Has that changed? Ali: The real Islam comes from Mecca. All people are God\u2019s people.

Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. Muslims who do not join the fight are called 'hypocrites' and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.\n\nUnlike nearly all of the Old Testament verses of violence, the verses of violence in the Quran are mostly open-ended, meaning that they are not restrained by the historical context of the surrounding text. They are part of the eternal, unchanging word of Allah, and just as relevant or subjective as anything else in the Quran.\n\nThe context of violent passages is more ambiguous than might be expected of a perfect book from a loving God, however this can work both ways. Most of today's Muslims exercise a personal choice to interpret their holy book's call to arms according to their own moral preconceptions about justifiable violence. Apologists cater to their preferences with tenuous arguments that gloss over historical fact and generally do not stand up to scrutiny. Still, it is important to note that the problem is not bad people, but bad ideology.\n\nUnfortunately, there are very few verses of tolerance and peace to abrogate or even balance out the many that call for nonbelievers to be fought and subdued until they either accept humiliation, convert to Islam, or are killed. Muhammad's own martial legacy - and that of his companions - along with the remarkable stress on violence found in the Quran have produced a trail of blood and tears across world history.\n\nOther than the fact that Muslims haven't killed every non-Muslim under their domain, there is very little else that they can point to as proof that theirs is a peaceful, tolerant religion. Where Islam is dominant (as in the Middle East and Pakistan) religious minorities suffer brutal persecution with little resistance. Where Islam is in the minority (as in Thailand, the Philippines and Europe) there is the threat of violence if Muslim demands are not met. Either situation seems to provide a justification for religious terrorism, which is persistent and endemic to Islamic fundamentalism.\n\nThe reasons are obvious and begin with the Quran. Few verses of Islam's most sacred text can be construed to fit the contemporary virtues of religious tolerance and universal brotherhood. Those that do are earlier \"Meccan\" verses which are obviously abrogated by later ones. This is why Muslim apologists speak of the \"risks\" of trying to interpret the Quran without their \"assistance\" - even while claiming that it is a perfect book.\n\nFar from being mere history or theological construct, the violent verses of the Quran have played a key role in very real massacre and genocide. This includes the brutal slaughter of tens of millions of Hindus for five centuries beginning around 1000 AD with Mahmud of Ghazni's bloody conquest. Both he and the later Tamerlane (Islam's Genghis Khan) slaughtered an untold number merely for defending their temples from destruction. Buddhism was very nearly wiped off the Indian subcontinent. Judaism and Christianity met the same fate (albeit more slowly) in areas conquered by Muslim armies, including the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe, including today's Turkey. Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of a proud Persian people is despised by Muslims and barely survives in modern Iran.\n\nSo ingrained is violence in the religion that Islam has never really stopped being at war, either with other religions or with itself.\n\nMuhammad was a military leader, laying siege to towns, massacring the men, raping their women, enslaving their children, and taking the property of others as his own. On several occasions he rejected offers of surrender from the besieged inhabitants and even butchered captives. He actually inspired his followers to battle when they did not feel it was right to fight, promising them slaves and booty if they did and threatening them with Hell if they did not. Muhammad allowed his men to rape traumatized women captured in battle, usually on the very day their husbands and family members were slaughtered.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that, for the most part, Muslim armies waged aggressive campaigns, and the religion's most dramatic military conquests were made by the actual companions of Muhammad in the decades following his death. The early Islamic principle of warfare was that the civilian population of a town was to be destroyed (ie. men executed, women and children taken as slaves) if they defended themselves. Although modern apologists often claim that Muslims are only supposed to attack in self-defense, this is an oxymoron that is flatly contradicted by the accounts of Islamic historians and others that go back to the time of Muhammad.\n\nConsider the example of the Qurayza Jews, who were completely obliterated only five years after Muhammad arrived in Medina. Their leader opted to stay neutral when their town was besieged by a Meccan army that was sent to take revenge for Muhammad's deadly caravan raids. The tribe killed no one from either side and even surrendered peacefully to Muhammad after the Meccans had been turned back. Yet the prophet of Islam had every male member of the Qurayza beheaded, and every woman and child enslaved, even raping one of the captives himself (what Muslim apologists might refer to as \"same day marriage\").\n\nOne of Islam's most revered modern scholars, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, openly sanctions offensive Jihad: \"In the Jihad which you are seeking, you look for the enemy and invade him. This type of Jihad takes place only when the Islamic state is invading other [countries] in order to spread the word of Islam and to remove obstacles standing in its way.\" Elsewhere, he notes: \"Islam has the right to take the initiative\u2026this is God\u2019s religion and it is for the whole world. It has the right to destroy all obstacles in the form of institutions and traditions \u2026 it attacks institutions and traditions to release human beings from their poisonous influences, which distort human nature and curtail human freedom. Those who say that Islamic Jihad was merely for the defense of the 'homeland of Islam' diminish the greatness of the Islamic way of life.\"\n\nThe widely respected Dictionary of Islam defines Jihad as \"A religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of Muhammad. It is an incumbent religious duty, established in the Qur'an and in the Traditions as a divine institution, and enjoined specially for the purpose of advancing Islam and of repelling evil from Muslims\u2026[Quoting from the Hanafi school, Hedaya, 2:140, 141.], \"The destruction of the sword is incurred by infidels, although they be not the first aggressors, as appears from various passages in the traditions which are generally received to this effect.\"\n\nMuhammad's failure to leave a clear line of succession resulted in perpetual internal war following his death. Those who knew him best first fought to keep remote tribes from leaving Islam and reverting to their preferred religion (the Ridda or 'Apostasy wars'). Then, within the closer community, early Meccan converts battled later ones. Hostility developed between those immigrants who had traveled with Muhammad to Mecca and the Ansar at Medina who had helped them settle in. Finally there was a violent struggle within Muhammad's own family between his favorite wife and favorite daughter - a jagged schism that has left Shias and Sunnis at each others' throats to this day.\n\nThe strangest and most untrue thing that can be said about Islam is that it is a Religion of Peace. If every standard by which the West is judged and condemned (slavery, imperialism, intolerance, misogyny, sexual repression, warfare...) were applied equally to Islam, the verdict would be devastating. Islam never gives up what it conquers, be it religion, culture, language or life. Neither does it make apologies or any real effort at moral progress. It is the least open to dialogue and the most self-absorbed. It is convinced of its own perfection, yet brutally shuns self-examination and represses criticism.\n\nThis is what makes the Quran's verses of violence so dangerous. They are given the weight of divine command. While Muslim terrorists take them as literally as anything else in their holy book, and understand that Islam is incomplete without Jihad, moderates offer little to contradict them - outside of opinion. Indeed, what do they have? Speaking of peace and love may win over the ignorant, but when every twelfth verse of Islam's holiest book either speaks to Allah's hatred for non-Muslims or calls for their death, forced conversion, or subjugation, it's little wonder that sympathy for terrorism runs as deeply as it does in the broader community - even if most Muslims personally prefer not to interpret their religion in this way.\n\nAlthough scholars like Ibn Khaldun, one of Islam's most respected philosophers, understood that \"the holy war is a religious duty, because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and (the obligation to) convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force\", many other Muslims are either unaware or willfully ignorant of the Quran's near absence of verses that preach universal non-violence. Their understanding of Islam comes from what they are taught by others. In the West, it is typical for believers to think that their religion must be like Christianity - preaching the New Testament virtues of peace, love, and tolerance - because Muslims are taught that Islam is supposed to be superior in every way. They are somewhat surprised and embarrassed to learn that the evidence of the Quran and the bloody history of Islam are very much in contradiction to this.\n\nOthers simply accept the violence. In 1991, a Palestinian couple in America was convicted of stabbing their daughter to death for being too Westernized. A family friend came to their defense, excoriating the jury for not understanding the \"culture\", claiming that the father was merely following \"the religion\" and saying that the couple had to \"discipline their daughter or lose respect.\" (source). In 2011, unrepentant Palestinian terrorists, responsible for the brutal murders of civilians, women and children explicitly in the name of Allah were treated to a luxurious \"holy pilgrimage\" to Mecca by the Saudi king - without a single Muslim voice raised in protest.\n\nFor their part, Western liberals would do well not to sacrifice critical thinking to the god of political correctness, or look for reasons to bring other religion down to the level of Islam merely to avoid the existential truth that this it is both different and dangerous.\n\nThere are just too many Muslims who take the Quran literally... and too many others who couldn't care less about the violence done in the name of Islam."], "summary": ["A Pennsylvania woman known as \u201cJihad Jane\u201d who became a follower of radical Islam and sought to kill a Swedish cartoonist was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison.

Only 13 percent of likely Democratic caucus participants said they view Islam as inherently violent, compared with 39 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nReligion, age, and location were important factors in shaping respondents' views. \u201cThere are four demographic groups in which the dominant opinion is that Islam is inherently violent: those who describe themselves as very conservative (62 percent), seniors (53 percent), those who live in rural areas (52 percent), and born-again Christians (51 percent),\u201d said J. Ann Selzer, president of West Des Moines-based Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cThose are the constituencies that drive up the overall percentage among likely Republican caucus-goers.\u201d\n\nIn either party, Selzer said, \u201cthe majority do not damn the whole religion for the actions of a few.\u201d Still, among Republicans, \u201cyou have more than one in three that considers it a violent religion.\u201d\n\nCharles Coffey, 65, Garden Grove, Iowa, is in that group. The retired driver, who is Christian, said that \u201cover the centuries even those who know Christ as savior have committed acts of war. But the Islamic religion has basically been assaultive on society since day one: 'Either you agree with us or we'll destroy you.'\u201d In Coffey's view, extremists' acts of terrorism, plus what he sees as unfair treatment of women by Muslim men and governments, both seem to him to spring from the Islamic faith, though he added: \u201cDon't get me wrong, I don't know that terribly much about it.\u201d\n\nHe was surprised to learn his view isn't held by a majority of likely Republican caucus-goers in his state. \u201cYou're kidding me,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cI thought more people were paying attention than that.\u201d\n\nCoffey favors Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, the Republican frontrunner in the poll, saying that part of Walker's appeal is his reputation for not bowing to political correctness. Coffey said if he were to hear Walker talking about Islam being a peaceful religion, it would give him pause. \u201cI'd have to have second thoughts about that, I really would,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an appearance Sunday on ABC's This Week, Walker didn't address religion when he said he's open to sending U.S. troops to the Middle East to fight the Islamic State in a \u201csurgical\u201d operation. He said that \u201caggressively, we need to take the fight to ISIS and any other radical Islamic terrorist in and around the world\u201d and that it's not a question of where but when radicals attempt an attack on U.S. soil.\n\nTaking the opposite view from Coffey was Alex Bellings, 27, a customer-service worker from Coralville and likely Republican caucus-goer who sees Islam as a peaceful religion. Bellings, who studied international and religious studies in college, said he thinks age makes \u201ca big difference\u201d in people's viewpoints.\n\n\u201cI have a very good friend who is a member of the Islam faith,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, we've had many in-depth discussion about Islam and America. And I think taking classes in far Eastern religions and understanding the cultures has been very helpful to me in coming to my own conclusions about things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a majority of Republicans younger than age 45, 63 percent, said they viewed Islam as inherently peaceful. Those age 45 and older were evenly split, with 46 percent saying they thought the religion was inherently violent and and 45 percent saying they thought it was peaceful.\n\nBellings' early favorites among 2016 prospects are Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and minister. He said he likes Huckabee because \u201ceven though he carries his religion on his sleeve, it doesn't seem to get in the way of his making rational or well thought-out decisions.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Bellings said former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, another Christian conservative, doesn't appeal to him because it \u201cseems like religion is the driving force with every decision he makes.\u201d\n\nSantorum has been among the most outspoken potential candidates on the issue. In November at Virginia's Liberty University, he said Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u201chave given all Muslims a pass.\u201d Santorum added that \u201cI'm not saying that all Muslims are terrorists, nor do I say that all Muslims support terrorism,\u201d but that in his view the threat from Islamic terrorists to the U.S. is \u201crooted in the belief in an all-powerful God and has over a billion adherents who are taught that their faith supersedes all other faith. In one form or another, Islam has been warring with western civilization for 1,300 years.\u201d\n\nThe poll found a wider gap in the views of likely GOP caucus-goers who are women (35 percent say inherently violent, 56 percent say inherently peaceful) than among men (42-50). Similarly, those likely Republican caucus attendees with a college education were more likely to say the religion is inherently peaceful, 58-35, than those without a college education, who were basically tied, 44-45.\n\nWhere Iowa Republicans are divided, likely Democratic caucus-goers in the survey responded overwhelmingly with a view of inherently peaceful Islam that holds across gender, age, and educational differences. \u201cI've just always felt like most religions, if they follow the Golden Rule, they are inherently peaceful,\u201d said June McMahill, 79, a Hillary Clinton supporter. \u201cThere's always been extremists and radical elements, even in the Christian faith, the Crusades and those types of things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn France, there's a backlash starting\u201d against Muslims, McMahill said. \u201cIt's bound to affect our thoughts and feelings, and I'm sure Republicans are going to be taking a tougher stance on it\u201d than Democrats.\n\n\u201cEveryone's going to have to raise their awareness, but not to the point of being phobic about it. You have to have some concern and not be blindsided but not be overreacting, either. Most of our Muslim people here are going to be fine, upstanding and just as concerned as the rest of us are,\u201d she said.\n\nShe thinks her views also are influenced by geography, she said. Her hometown, Glenwood, sits not far from the Nebraska line and Offutt Air Force Base, and as a result, \u201cmaybe we've been exposed a little bit more\u201d to diversity through the U.S. military, she said.\n\nDennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University in Des Moines, said voters' evolving views on Islam and its relationship to terrorism may well influence the debate, particularly in the Republican caucuses. In poll results released earlier this week, a quarter of likely Republican caucus-goers identified terrorism as the most important issue for the next president to address, compared to 10 percent of Democrats.\n\nWhat's unclear is how candidates will address the issue, or whether it will play a more indirect role in campaign messaging, perhaps by adding pressure on libertarian-leaning candidates such as Paul to abandon isolationist strategies.\n\n\u201cThere is a side of the party that feels the country is under attack by both the immigration issue and the Islamic terrorism issue and they want a solution,\u201d Goldford said.\n\nThe 39 percent in the Iowa Republican sample who see the Islamic faith as violent are \u201ca pretty big chunk,\u201d he added. \u201cSo you certainly have to address their concerns. The question is not whether they'll address it, it's how they address it. And Democrats will have to deal with this, in terms of the general election certainly.\u201d\n\nImam Johari Adbul-Malik, the outreach director at Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Va., said he was encouraged by the fact that majorities in both parties considered Islam to be peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe're trending in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cOn balance, I think it's more good news than bad news.\u201d"], "summary": ["The view is\u00a0bound to shape the 2016 debate."]}, {"title": ["'Throw the bastards out': an American tradition from settlers to Trump"], "text": ["This past summer, I was guest-teaching in Europe. When the talk of the town wasn\u2019t Brexit, it was the US election. It was discussed the way you\u2019d discuss an alien invasion: bizarre.\n\nA look at US history, however, suggests that this election is far from unusual, and that Donald Trump\u2019s populist, anti-Washington cry to Make America Great Again emerges from the foundational belief of many early settlers: that they were the chosen ones who saw corruption and fought it, building a world cleansed of its sins.\n\nThis ethos embodies what Jean-Jacques Rousseau called \u201ccivil religion\u201d \u2013 that is, the features that undergird political, social and economic behavior. In America\u2019s case, the sociologist Robert Bellah described the country\u2019s civil religion through its symbols: the Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and Sacrificial Death and Rebirth.\n\nThese optimistic, populist, and nativist traditional underpinnings help explain why Americans think about politics as they do: we bring a good deal of fervor to these symbols.\n\nOur country\u2019s most pressing issues \u2013 from purchasing power stagnation to rust belt job loss \u2013 tend to be concrete and measurable. But solutions, as they project into the future, are a matter of belief. Americans \u2013 heir to people so devout they crossed an ocean to stay true to principle \u2013 have faith in what will save the day. It\u2019s \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d when it comes to describing problems. When it comes to solutions, beliefs count.\n\nThe main issue facing voters can be summed up by the significant drop in upward mobility. America is the most unequal of all western nations: our \u201cGini\u201d (inequality) index is 85.1, in line with Chile\u2019s 81.4, India\u2019s 81.3, Indonesia\u2019s 82.8, and Kazakhstan\u2019s 86.7. The top 20% of households own over 84% of the wealth; the bottom 40% own 0.3%. In both the working and middle classes, people feel sidelined or fear their children soon will be.\n\nSuch are the problems agreed upon by voters across the political spectrum, from Sanders backers to Trump supporters. In coming to solutions, Americans bring fervor particularly to what Bellah described as Sacrificial Death and Rebirth. This includes not only a future orientation, rebirth and \u201cstart anew!\u201d, but death to the old and decayed.\n\nThe Christian narrative of crucifixion and resurrection and the national tale of leaving the old world have anchored the story of Death and Rebirth in the American civil creed. In it, we hear echoes of the preacher\u2019s \u201crid ye of the devil\u201d and traces of the political call to \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d.\n\nThis election year, it\u2019s clearest in the Trump campaign but emerges in alternative form in Democratic positions. Populist demands grow loud when the \u201cbastards\u201d are identified as Washington insiders, constrainers of liberties, corrupt and incompetent. Nativist demands increase when the \u201cbastards\u201d are immigrants or other suspect groups. In both, a troubled world will be set right when evil forces are purged.\n\nThe country was born in a revolution against central government, but long before, early settlers, fleeing the centralization of Charles I, were wary of London: the king\u2019s men were the bastards to be thrown out in order to preserve local control. \u201cThe Congregational churches and self-contained towns of Massachusetts,\u201d the historian TH Breen writes, \u201cstood as visible evidence of the founders\u2019 decision to preserve in America what had been threatened in the mother country.\u201d\n\nThe many early settlers who were religious dissenters were doubly suspicious of government, first for its centralizing efforts and second for the persecution it had foisted upon them. Internal migration through sparsely settled land contributed to the dismissal of central government and growing self-reliance, as there was relatively little government to rely on. Individual initiative and local community were the keys to survival.\n\nNational government took a larger role as the country grew, yet the value of individual and local effort combined with a suspicion of central authorities were rooted in America\u2019s civil faith.\n\nProtestantism, born also in revolution (against Rome), added to the mix. The mandate to read the Bible for oneself and find one\u2019s own path to God encouraged the view that the responsible moral agent is the individual (with guidance from her local church). The Great Awakenings of the 1730s-1740s and 1820s-50s were festivals of individual iconoclasm, religious groups splintering off from established institutions, and populist religious ideas.\n\nReformed Protestantism, which came to America through Puritan and other Calvinist traditions, had an even stronger impact on political development. It held that the sovereign nation does not start with central government but with the local covenanted community \u2013 the foedus \u2013 which form networks to constitute the nation. It\u2019s these ideas that gave the US its federal system of government and the continuing political and legal battles about states\u2019 rights.\n\nDuring the revolution, America\u2019s churches sided with the rebels, not London. Among the more anti-authoritarian sects was Arminianism \u2013 or in America, Methodism \u2013 in which the accent shifted subtly to the individual\u2019s role in salvation. It was a faith well-suited to a self-reliant nation wary of authorities, and America embraced it. The number of Methodist churches rose from 20 in 1770 to 19,883 in 1860. By the mid-19th century, two Kentucky preachers could in good anti-authoritarian conscience opine: \u201cWe are not personally acquainted with the writings of John Calvin \u2026 neither do we care.\u201d\n\nWhen Reagan said government was the problem, he was channeling American history and zeal\n\nFrom this history came the myth, reality and creed of self-reliant localism and suspicion of central authority. Reliance on government is for the faint and faithless of heart. When Reagan said government was the problem, he was channelling American history and zeal.\n\nToday, Trump is giving this civil religion voice in populist form, and because \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d is rooted in US culture and worldview, it wins votes.\n\nIn April 2016, the Public Religion Research Institute reported: \u201cTwo-thirds of Trump supporters think the nation needs a leader who breaks the rules\u201d (a ritual redux of Boston\u2019s \u201cthrow the bastards out\u201d Tea Party). Other Republican candidates had populist, small-government positions but lacked Trump\u2019s feathers-and-warpaint yelp. Ted Cruz came closest, which is one reason, along with his social conservatism, why he was second in line and why there is substantial support for his running in 2020.\n\nEven when Trump says he\u2019d keep governmental social security for retirees, his jeremiad is brimstone and hellfire for Washington. The more unflinchingly Trump preaches, the more it \u201cclicks\u201d with the national creed and the more satisfying it feels.\n\nTrump University taught: \u201cYou don\u2019t sell products, benefits or solutions \u2013 you sell feelings.\u201d Trump had no hand in the development of America\u2019s civil-religious anti-authoritarian feelings, but he taps into them. His first and continuing charge against Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine is that they are \u201cultimate insiders\u201d.\n\nIn nativist form, \u201crid ye of the devil\u201d is extended from the populist Satan of big government to other spoilers of the City on the Hill, especially traditionally suspect groups like immigrants and Muslims. Many factors go into antipathy against these communities, and surveys have correlated support for Trump with pre-existing intolerance for immigrants, racial minorities, and Muslims. But intolerance becomes calls for deportation and border closings where \u201cthrow the devil out\u201d is seen as the way to save a fallen world.\n\nOne definition of \u201ctragic\u201d is getting behind solutions that don\u2019t solve problems. Closing borders to keep or throw the bastards out will probably not address America\u2019s economic or national security problems. Given the extensive vetting process, it\u2019s not clear that barring Muslims will boost security, but it does do Isis\u2019s PR for them, giving weight to the claim that America is in a war against all Muslims. It\u2019s also not clear that reducing immigration would yield economic benefits, since legal and illegal immigrants to the US create companies and jobs and boost the economy by a surplus of $35bn annually, benefiting all but the lowest earners.\n\nAmerica\u2019s employment crisis could be addressed through education, job (re)training, and regional redevelopment, for a start. But these options lack the satisfaction of \u201cride \u2019em out of town\u201d.\n\nWhat of Clinton and the year-long outpouring of support for Sanders? Though they occupy different positions on the Democratic spectrum, they, like Obama, preach America\u2019s alternative gospel: government is not the devil that should be kept as small as possible; instead, it should be large enough to give the little guy a leg-up. The Clinton platform builds on the Roosevelt Institute\u2019s policy recommendations that government \u201crewrite the rules\u201d for broad-based distribution of resources.\n\nThis American gospel too believes in \u201ccast out the old to build the new\u201d. Obama, after all, also campaigned on \u201cChange\u201d in the American civil creed idiom. But this alternative \u201cchange\u201d and creed sees government as the agent responsible for maintaining opportunities for ordinary people and for ensuring that the middle class is the largest class, which it is no longer.\n\nThe economic tsunami of 2008 has added to the problems that have been accumulating since the 1980s \u2013 not only purchasing power stagnation but the fear that it will worsen.\n\nAmerica is in a civil-religious war about its response. Rid-ye-of the-devil\u2019s-government remains America\u2019s first and oldest civil religion. It faces the newer \u201cleg up\u201d creed. Seventy-two percent of Democrats and those leaning Democratic see a major role for the government in lifting people out of poverty; only 36% of Republicans do. Eighty-two percent of Democrats see government as having a major role to play in healthcare; only 34% of Republicans do.\n\nThe apostles of each creed, like the circuit-rider preachers who traversed America, cross the country today with their campaign staffs, hoping to save the nation.\n\nMarcia Pally teaches multilingual multicultural studies at New York University.

Really, one of the best I've seen on this subject.\n\nI have to mention though as a small addendum that Mohammed wasn't even in the bear costume... santa was...\n\nPeople are getting this all wrong.. It's not WHO you show, it's WHAT you show,\n\nthats why the super best episode is fine, and that's why the Danist cartoons, showing him as a TERRORIST which is WHAT they're showing, is wrong\n\nJust wanted to add....I am a muslim and a huge fan of South Park, I have to admit that episode 200 did make me uncomfortable and honestly I did not want to watch the sequel (201). However one does have to respect free speech and if that speech makes you uncomfortable then simply do not watch it. If you absolutely have to protest there are many civilized ways of doing so.\n\nI think what this radical website did is absolutely inexcusable. These radicals are a small minority but because of their bellicose and belligerent behavior they make the rest of us look bad and indeed foolish.\n\nBelieve me there are many moderates in the muslim fold who would rather see these radicals gone than South Park or its creators.\n\nAnd i thought Islam was the 'religion of peace'. For years Christianity has put up with endless insults against its members, its orders, its Lord and God. Believe me, I've seen some pretty foul drawings of Jesus in my time, but we are taught to 'turn the other cheek', which has made us much more different than our needlessly aggressive Muslim counterparts.\n\nDeath threats are not the best way to tell people that your religion is peaceful. Morons.\n\nThe world will be a much safer place when we finally have freedom FROM religion.\n\nThere is no debate within Muslims about wither this is ok or not. What these cartoonist are trying to do is tarnish the image of Islam and it wont work. South Park should have been taken off air many times before even when they showed an image of Jesus because Muslims believe no profit not just Mohammad should be falsely exposed like that.\n\nMuslims just need to let go of things cuz look where they at right now almost all muslim countries third world countries they just need to let go of things and move forward. Oh btw i seem to recall that muslims also believe that Moses and Jesus were prophets of god too and south park has made fun of them in the past before so why Mohammad? Please dont tell me god has favorites otherwise you guys arent even close to understanding him\n\nAnyone remember the underlying message of the movie \"Billy Jack?\" --\"Love your neighbor or I'll kill you.\"\n\nI agree.. when they first showed the Super Best Friends episode nothing happend, even though South Park made fun of about every single subject out there. I'm a Roman Catholic and when they showed God as a small messed up creature, i had concerns.. but there was no revolt against that episode.. Beacuse in all religion is mainly peace and love with your fellow man, but radicals take it to the extreme and make it seem like some religons are wrong and thiers is right.. in the end theres only one supreme being that whatches over everything..\n\nI agree, Mohammed was aired in July of 2001. Pepole didnt get mad because that. It's called humor people. South park was not just making fun of muslims, they need to know that. They go off on everyone, in a funny manor.\n\nWhat really bugs me is that Mohamed cants be depicted however, its one of the most popular names in Islamic countries... I just don't get it, if you cant depict him, why can you use his name to name your children? In a way you are branding his name unto your children and then your children are a depiction of the prophet? But wait... I am not Muslim, i don't understand these things at all. We are just a bunch of idiots in the west that don't understand how powerful religion can be on simple minded 3rd world countries.\n\nIn a perfect world we could pick and choose who is allowed to identify with our faith, but unfortunately it just doesn't work that way. When a few bad people disguised as holy men obtained positions of leadership in the Catholic church and committed horrible crimes against children, the church's public image suffered a worldwide blow and all Catholics, including myself, must now live with the common perception that our churches are havens for child molesters.\n\nWhile >99% of Muslims may be good, peace-loving people, the other <1% have hijacked your faith and used it to commit heinous acts disguised as holy deeds. As a fellow innocent bystander of my faith's \"bad apples,\" my advice to Muslims is to wholeheartedly take a stance against these evil people. Don't split hairs, such as disagreeing with the acts but sympathizing with the root cause. Don't defend any aspect of who they are and what they do. You are either for or against the evils committed under the guise of your faith. If you're for them in any way, you're no better than they are. For my part, I am wholeheartedly against what has happened within the Catholic church and think church officials right up to the Pope should answer and pay dearly for it.\n\n@MuchRaker Yeah, what's up with that? His special power was fire and nobody said \"boo!\". It was a good episode.\n\n@upset people Take a note from any intolerant organization and realize that intolerance only gets you further alienated from the people you are intolerant of ..and guess what.. you have to live with those people because 1) you couldn't possibly kill them all. 2) so far this is the only planet we've got.\n\nI also don't see what the fuss is about this time as Mohammed was never depicted in the episode except in a stick-figure sketch(which apparently isn't being talked about). Just because you SAY Mohammed is in a bear costume doesn't mean he's actually in there. It could be Sea Man. It could be anyone. The Gingers got it right \"How do we know that's Mohammed in there?\".\n\nYou know what? This whole time Cartman was actually Mohammed and they've been secretly depicting him all along. They were planning on letting that cat out of the bag on the farewell episode. Sorry, Matt and Trey, for blowing your big surprise.\n\nNo mention at all that in part II, Mohammed in a bear suit....wasn't?\n\nHEH not only was he depicted, he had fire from his hands\n\nseriously this is free speech, this is america it sickens me that comedy central wouldn't back up stone and parker\n\nWow.. just wow. It's ok to pick on everything and anything except Muslims. Watch the hate deepen against the Muslim religion.\n\nThe REALLY funny thing is that it was actually SANTA CLAUS in the bear suit, not the unmentionable prophet. The boys on the show knew what they were doing and fooled not only all the other characters on the show, but all the zealots in real-life.\n\nAlso, they didn't even mention his name...every time they did, it was censored.\n\nWhat have we become as a free nation when one (and only one) religion has been afforede the ability to use threats and/or violence to prevent social commentary, satire or discusson about their religion or religious leader.\n\nMany groups will use these excuses to hire more people to work against western interest.\n\nSeriously they depicted the nature or Muslim censorship not allah himself.\n\nThe reaction at Comedy Central and the US government is spineless kowtowing to those who threaten and terrorize our values! I have a much better plan for dealing with this group \"Revolution Muslim\", and it can be summed up in two words: Guantanamo Bay.\n\nDown with the extremists, off with their heads. Your just like gays all you do is cause trouble and nobody really cares or likes you. They make fun of Jesus all the time and do you see me crying. No grow up and shut up\n\nI was pretty dissapointed that the episode didn't air as it was originally intended. Active Muslims (and I mean active as in pursuing violence and extremism) in America are blowing this way out of proportion. It's a cartoon people, that's it...get over it. I hope the CIA is keeping an eye on this group. I feel that they pose a threat not only to our country, but to me as well. I love South Park, and because I like their story lines doesn't give anyone the right to act violently towards me. Go South Park, I hope you play episode \"201\" as it was intended. Don't be afraid, there are a lot of supporters out there. This is American, so exercise your amendment rights!\n\nOne thing being upset by Southpark's satire of Muhammed, downright ridiculous when threats of people's life are at risk over what is essentially a cartoon. This just further exposes the radical over the top attitudes of Islamic fundamentalists. Jew's get ridiculed all the time by Southpark (as do many other groups) with constant stereotyping yet they seem to understand and grasp the tongue in cheek satire nature of the show, why can't these Muslim people to?\n\nSouth Park is awesome. I think it's a joke that Muslims feel that their religion is above everyone elses. As pointed out in the article, every religion has been open to being made fun of on South Park, But God forbid Mohammad gets made fun of. Now you have people rioting and making threats all because a simple portrayal was made on a comedy show? Absolutely rediculous. I completely agree with the end of the article saying how the muslim people need to realize that acting like this portrays them as ignorant themselves.\n\nIt seems to me that if Muslims think that no one can mention their prophet, then they should live in a country that does not have freedom of speech.\n\nThere are plenty of countries that I am sure are more then willing to provide them with the censorship they want!\n\nYou mean to tell me after 9/11, there is a \"radical Islamic group based in New York City\" hello, no picked up on that one!\n\nWhy is ok to depic Buddha doing cocaine and Jesus watching porn and Moses as the bad guy from Tron but not ok to say the name Mohammed? It's like saying Islam is more sacred than all other religions!\n\nI wanted to point out that in both episodes , there isn't an image of the prophet but a black rectangle. I don't think it is fair to criticized and sensor in a country wish the first right is of speech, if Muslim wants to be taken seriously in the modern world they will have to accept the fact that they are other people in the world that do not believe in Islam. I'm not taking anything away from them but and it is a bid BUT, South Park is a Cartoon. Their whole point was the media cowardly reaction of the 2005 rots. If they had put Some other religious icon, let's say Mithra from the old Persian religion, NOBODY would have cared. Only child break into violence when they are angry, adults have civil discussion. If they are so mad that the western world guaranty freedom of speech well, go to Saudi Arabia. Nobody criticizes the prophet there.\n\nDon't forget to mention the character in the bear costume ended up being Santa Claus. I don't want to get into a religious debate about Islam, but an image of Mohammed was never shown, so I don't get all of these extremists who are talking about us \"seeing\" the prophet.\n\nWhen will we seriously address the threat of capitulating to fundamentalist thinking?\n\nI mean, look, I can certainly see the sound reasoning behind why MUSLIMS would be forbidden from depicting Mohammed in any way, shape or form: because Mohammed (or whoever it was who issued the decree), understood man's tendency to idolize people. You see, he wanted the focus to be on the Qua'ran instead of the man. Okay, I got it. And that's fine. (I mean, makes sense given what happened during Moses' absence from his people when he ascended Mt. Sainai to bring God's [written] commandments down from the mountaintop for them).\n\nBut, as such, it must be emphasized that this decree against depicting Mohammed is and always has been strictly imposed upon Muslims... AND MUSLIMS ONLY.\n\nMuslim FUNDAMENTALISTS seek to twist and distort the teachings of Islam to their own selfish ambitions by trying to force the non-Muslim rest of the world to adopt Muslim standards.\n\nIt's time for the Muslim NON-extremists to start confronting the crazies operating in the name of Islam and Allah.\n\nIt troubles me greatly that you don't see a movement among modern, socially-progressive Muslims to denounce fundamentalism in all its guises but especially those that operate under their own religious label 'Muslim'.\n\nPosted by: Andrew B. Bosma\n\nThis is getting old.. move on already.. Muslim's should just shrug their shoulders, and move on.. I mean in Christianity when you are struck you are supposed to turn the other cheek right?.. well that can even be the same when they portray Jesus..Shrug thier Shoulders (turn their cheeks) and move on!! Thats why you don't hear controversy with Christians.. this is plain and simple.. Its not like you will get struck down if you (muslims) shrug your shoulders and ignore it or even laugh... c'mon.. where is the humor.. Guess the making of that movie \"Looking for Comedy in a Muslim World\" never got flack whe it came out.. so whats the big deal.. South Park portrayed a Muslim prophet inside of a Bear Costume...ok why are Muslims so ashamed to Show off or even display their beloved prophet?? Buddah is shown, Many of the Hindu gods are shown, Jesus is shown, Moses is shown, what gives?? Did he even exist?? Stop complaining and shrug your shoulders and MOVE ON!!!!!!\n\nWhat amuses me about this article is that the two \"Muslim Scholars\" aren't muslim at all and have obviously left the religion based on their own negative experiences (which I would never invalidate.) However If you are going to provide a balanced voice for the muslim community as it relates to how we view the depiction of the Prophet Muhammed (peace and blessings be upon him) Please reach out to people who do not consider themselves atheists. I do not understand why we as muslims get so upset when unbelievers depict our prophet (pbuh) in negative ways or talk against Islam. It is the duty of the shaitan to do such. We don't have to do anything but believe in what we believe in and allow others to believe what they believe Like Surah Al-Kafirun tells us. The Quran explicitly tells us that this is the way:\n\nSay (O Prophet): O ye who reject faith! (1) \u0644\u064e\u0622 \u0623\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0628\u064f\u062f\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0628\u064f\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e I worship not that which ye worship; (2) \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0622 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0639\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0628\u0650\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0622 \u0623\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0628\u064f\u062f\u064f Nor worship ye that which I worship.

(4) \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0622 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0639\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0628\u0650\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0622 \u0623\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0628\u064f\u062f\u064f Nor will ye worship that which I worship. (5) \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0649\u064e \u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0650 Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion. (6)\n\nThe key part being Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.\n\nLet the unbelievers do what they will because there is nothing we can do about it.\n\nWhat's wrong with people these days? Did you completely miss the fact that they made fun of almost every other religous leader, too? It's not like South park is singling out a religion and bashing it. I thought that the 200th episode was hilarious. People need to stop being so sensitive and get over it. It's just a cartoon tv show(and an awesome one at that). There are worse things to freak out about. We keep bending over backwards because of fear of violence. Well we can always fight violence with violence. We need to stop allowing radical groups to make our decisions for us.\n\nYou know, the following string of 8 ascii characters .. mohammed .. isn't a picture of the man, but it does represent him in text, and muslims are not offended. But if I choose a different set of 5 ascii characters .. \u00c7:-]= .. to represent him in text, should muslims now be offended? After all, some people might chose to tilt their heads and imagine seeing a turbin, eyes, nose, mouth, and beard - and suddently to them its now a picture. Should CNN print this comment? Or censor it for fear of it generating death threats. What has this world of ours become?\n\nDeluded. Absolute delusion. Delusions of grandeur found in a book. In a book called the Koran/Quran.\n\nSouth Park is less so. Where is the South Park religion?\n\nSouth Park shows no mercy to any religion. Wouldn't not showing this episode be like giving into the threats and fear that terrorist try to push upon us. Not that I believe all Islams are terrorists. I don't believe that at all, but for the ones that are, they try to bully the world into fearing them. I think this shows that we wont be bullied or fear stricken into silence.\n\nThe fact that these people burned down buildings because of a Danish cartoon in the 1st place shows you how crazy they are...they need to get their heads right...\n\nI wish someone in hollywood would make a real movie about Mohamed and the rise of the Islamic empire. I know it would be controversial to show someone playing Mohamed but tough puckies. People are so afraid of other peoples crazy eccentric behavior that they tip toe around. I think a history based \u2013 well researched movie or miniseries about Mohamed and Omar would be very enlightening and educational to the world.\n\nMuslims are too sensitive and it's time we stopped kissing their butts. If a muslim draws a caricature of Jesus we Christains are not going to hunt him down and kill him. I keep copies of the \"Muhammed\" cartoons on my computer and share them with folks all over the world. Try to stop me. Mark Montgomery NYC, NY\n\nThe white male Christian is the evil satan. Everything bad in this world comes from the evil white man. Specifically those whites north of Italy and Spain, Those evil doomed northern Europeans and our Christianity. Islam is such a disenfranchised helpless little religion, only stuggling to bring peace happiness and joy to those who believe in MOE-HAM-ADD...hey I said HAM is'nt that pig flesh?!?!? Hey do the Moslems/Islamic Sunny sheeeeeite know this? Their prophet has a little porcine in his name..oooohhhhhh. Let me guess now some is-lam-ic fundementalist is screaming \"DEATH TO THE INFIDEL\". Grow up, not everyone likes you or your silly cult of moons and stars. Go back to your sand box, make your 5 year old daughter marry some 50 year old camel rapist, and when she tries to free herself from this insanity, stone her to death like you normally do, or like the latest one, cut off her nose. Yeah a real great religion..belong to us or we KILL YOU.\n\nPosted by: lord of the isles\n\nI hope they would get their 72 virgins right now, but instead stop crying like little babies about mohammad related stuff.\n\nListen ppl .. Mohammed was NOT GOD.. so get over it .. you seem to accept it and laugh when Christ was on.. Southpark doesnt pick and choose, so lets just move on .. he was a human, so lets not make more of it than it is.. This is why the rest of the world thinks middle easterns are a bunch of angry ppl .. HYPOCRTICeS\n\nwhy cant we simply refrain from \"intentionally\" doing things that obviously upset other fellow human beings. this seems to be upsetting not one or two, but an awful lot of people is it not? wouldn't the world be so much more peaceful if we make the feeblest attempt to not \"knowingly\" do things that hurt or offend others? is it really that difficult? or are we just ignorant to the fact, because we just don't give a damn...\n\noh and BTW, welcome to USA.. Freedom of Speech .. something Islam doe not allow nor tolerates\n\nI am sick and tired of Muslims hitting the streets when their prophet is portrayed in a negative way. Or even when they are profiled in airports. WHY are the muslims not putting out the same energy when cowardly terrorists acts are commited. Nothing but silence.... Muslims need to wake up and smell the couscous. They cannot keep silent on injustice of innocent lives.\n\nGreat article and great comments from you all.\n\n1 correction though.... you won't find too many Islamic clerics that would ever say that the Qur'an contradicts itself. It is the people who contradicts themselves and their believes.\n\nAs a believer of the Qur'anic text and as a military person, I would have to say that everyone should take a closer look at 'why' they are doing and saying what they are.\n\n... Why? ..... \u2013 do non-Muslims hate something they don't understand? \u2013 Are we all so convuluted and biased? - do Muslims get so offend by people who do things out of ignorance and disrespect?\n\nMy suggestion is that everyone should try toview both sides of the story and that everyone should read what it is that the Muslims believe in. That is the only hope that you have to come to understanding\n\nPeace be with you all, Teddy\n\nBTW... Muslims also don't depict God, Jesus, Moses, Abraham, or any other Prophet.\n\nWe make fun of all the religious models because you are a part of our culture in America. It is a compliment, not an insult.\n\nITs just an over reaction from Muslims about a stupid yet funny cartoon the bashed every religion but you dont see any one else taking it as slander. It just goes to prove how much religion is overrated! Tremendously.\n\nSHAME ON YOU \"Comedy Central\" for your censoring of the 201 episode. SHAME ON YOU!!!\n\nI suppose congratulations goes out to the Islamic extremists... Comedy central cowered in fear and further censored the second episode. If this is how America is going to handle these extremists perhaps they will be able to accomplish their goal of assimilation. As for the moderated Muslims on this blog that say they like south park but they didn't like their profit being made fun of... then you are not a south park fan because news flash... THATS WHAT THEY DO!! They make everyone a little uncomfortable. I find it fascinating that some are ok with South Park insulting every other religion (including the creators religion), so long as its not theirs. There was at time when Muslim nations were at the forefront of scientific and cognitive development... it would seem that modern Islam shuns logic, reason, and accountability, in favor of fear based extremism. In response countries are banning burka wearing, and the building of minarets (Switzerland). Until moderate Muslims take back their religion and literally expel the extremists from their ranks, something they are clearly terrified to do. The legacy of this generation of Muslims will be not be looked on kindly by historians.\n\nTo follow up in a more rational manner my desire for a movie or mini-series on Islam. People, especially Americans, are lazy and uninformed in general. They get their history from movies becuase they are too lazy to read. This ban on showing Mohamed is one of the reasons why non-muslims are so untrusting and fearful of Islam. Fear of the unknown. If the movie was made fairly, by non-muslims, it should be okay. becuase no muslim has violated their own beliefs. see the above quote from the Quran: Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion. (6) So in my religion it is perfectly fine to depict a historical figure in a movie. And you cannot dispute Mohamed is one of the most interesting and important historical figures we have ever had as a species. Maybe through education we can achieve understanding and lasting peace. But if we keep knowledge in the dark we will all keep running blindly into each other. Just trying to interject some reason into the mix....\n\nAbdul Aziz you write what looks like gibberish aka garbage. Blame your fanatics and the acts of 9/11 for how your people are portrayed.\n\nI question, when will terrorists against the middle east arise? When will these terrorists do to your people what terrorists of Islam have done to Americs? It's long past due. The American military is baby sitting you right now because of the havoc your people wreak on the rest of the world, based from your religion.\n\nTo Mr Seekrtheidiot's comment \"But wait... I am not Muslim, i don't understand these things at all. We are just a bunch of idiots in the west that don't understand how powerful religion can be on simple minded 3rd world countries.\"\n\nI want him to read the article and understand that it was the Muslim group in New York, a city of the developed world, that started the uproar. The simple minded folks of the 3rd world probably hadnt even seen the episode. To Mr seeker, its not a matter of who lives where. Religious fundamentalism is independant of boundaries, and it exists as much in America as it does in the 'simple minded' third world. This is an issue of religious fanaticism and not the IQ of people.\n\nPosted by: Seeker the wise\n\nCould this article be slanted any more towards the Muslim viewpoint of the situation?\n\nWhen southpark aired muhammad before in the episode 'super best friends', there was no outrage then. So whats the big deal? have muslims all of a sudden become offended by it? or have we become weak? I think both, extreme muslims realise they have a power over the west now because we are weak.\n\nGuess what, im offended that the muslim prophet, muhammad, was a pedo. He actually had sex with a 9 year old girl, after marrying her when she was 6. So should I threaten with violence etc? Should we censor anything to do with islam because of this fact?\n\nNeither Islam, Christianity nor Judaism rules the world, neither does any other religion... No religion will ever rule the world in the sense of imposing their beliefs onto others. You can try to rule the world big 3 monotheistic religions and history has shown you have tried, tried and failed, Human nature will not allow it, we will always rebel (FYI you all are worshiping the same god just disagree on how)...It's not going to happen so let's move on and worship who we want to and how we want to... or not (shout out to the athiests out there) Just don't tell me what I should believe, let me choose for myself.\n\nactually in the first airing of the broadcast he was cencsored. in all previous re-airings and on the dvd he was not censored.\n\nIslam will one day conquor the West and subdue the West under the Islamic banner and the Holy Koran will be the highest law of the land. Inshallah ! Allah O Akbar !!!\n\nSo keep up the hate and as you can see western women are converting to islam in mass and even men because Islam is a great religion and Mohammed is the finest example to mankind.\n\nFree speech being stripped away in front of my eyes because of lunatic Muslims. They have surely won the war.\n\nJust another case showing how awful religion is for our world. The fact that this is such a big issue is just sad honestly, and it shows how ignornant our world is still. Hopwfully one day people will understand how ridiculous this kind of thing really is, but I'm not hopeful to be honest\n\ni dont understand why everyone is so mad, its not as if the writers are trying to make fun of mohammed, absolutely no negative aspect associated with him. besides there is no god. i hope that the writers do not give in to these extremist threats and that they push full heartedly to get this fictional being on the air. he is not real, neither is jesus. just my personal opinion\n\nthe dark ages ended in Europe a long time ago and ideas have flourished in the foreground as the influence of the church withered. I only hope that the middle east has a similar awakening and turns away from nonsensical traditions to fulfill their own hopes and goals peacefully.\n\nhaha redact, i do understand. i just think its silly, like mohammed\n\nIf Mohammed saw that episode he would laugh his socks off!!\n\nWow! I just read this article and the following comments! Talk about craziness! Long and the short, like many others said, Southpark is a CARTOON! It's a FICTIONAL piece of work. Its very design is to be controversial and they do a fine job at it! I believe in religious freedom. Worship whomever you want, from Buddha, Jesus, God, Allah and his Prophet, whatever higher power you want to believe in. Who cares! Religion is a personal choice and if you choose (key phrase; you choose) to let it upset you (whomever you may be), let it incite you to violence, well...maybe, just maybe you might want to take a good hard look at why you've allowed it to make you feel that way. Again, loved the comments and the article was great!\n\nWhy do you pat too much the muslim people.Mohamed was the worst.Thi is the truth.\n\nTo any rational non-Muslim I say, respect our religion just as we respect yours in our own countries. We don't depict or make fun of Jesus or Moses, so you should do the same.\n\nBut my main comment goes out to Muslims because obviously it is impossible to debate with the irrational disbelievers.\n\nSo the main question is: Why were you watching this kafir show? It is made by kafirs, displayed on a kafir network. They are disbelievers and they are making fun of their own prophets and religions, let alone yours.\n\nIn a Muslim country, it is obvious that the law prohibits and punishes such blasphemy, and we thank Allah for that. But in a kafir country, you cannot expect kafirs to always have respect for others as they have even lost any self-respect for being disbelievers. If you are in the unfortunate position of living in such a country, then you should make every effort to distance yourself from them, that includes not watching their TV stations.\n\nPeople have forgot that there is five buttons on the t.v Two to turn the channels an other two to turn the volume and if all else fails the power button\n\nPosted by: The lone wolf\n\nI am a Mormon and South Park did an entire episode mocking the prophet of my faith, Joseph Smith. Mormons being Christians also accept Jesus Chtist as the Messiah and we all know how South Park has portrayed Jesus. I bring all of this up because I am drawing a distinction between myself and the radical Islamic terrorist who are suceeding in stifleing free speech in America. They are playing on our fears of offending people to frighten us into submission. I am very tired of this whole battle between radical terrorists and western civilization. I sincerly hope that we will gain courage as a country and say that we are not afraid of them.\n\nI am sorry, but Muslims do tend to overreact to perceive slights and injustices. You didn't see the Mormons all up in arms when South Park made huge fun of their Prophet Joseph Smith. Actually, no one of any Christian faith or those of the Jewish faith seem to get upset at South Park over their humor and in many ways, insulting treatment of revered religious figures.\n\nI think we all try to not offend people and we try to be sensitive to other's beliefs and such, but we are also a free people, who are allowed to express ourselves under freedom of speech. President Obama and other leaders get it left and right, but they do not try to incarcerate those who takes pot shots at them, because those people have the freedom to do just that.\n\nMuslims need to relax about this. It is a darn shame that a small minority of a faith can cause so much trouble for the majority of their believers.\n\nI don't know what's up with America? Where is the Freedom of speech? Why is it OK that South Park make jokes with Christianiti and Judaism, bu not with Islam? Are they protected because they make threats? I didn't know that America is so scared....\n\nIt is the sad truth that every Muslim has to accept that Mohammed had 12 wives and did sex with 9 years girl and also with own daughter in law. He was so successful in preaching polygamy that every Muslim today has 4-8 wives and 8-10 children. He has made the most impact in the world history by having billions of people following his ideology of halal/holy killing of non Muslim. He also brought equality among races.\n\nI am not Muslim, but leave the Muslims in peace. Go and mock your own country, your own institutions, and your own people and have a great blast on your own miseries. Stop offending others and then complaining like little girls. Yes, a good smack on the head of those show producers would be a great reminder that there are sacred things in this world, and if you don't believe is your problem.\n\nseriously? there are a few people who have posted that i agree with because they are calm, non-emotional opinions, and because they make very good points. one of these is that if you dont like it, dont watch it. dont go on the internet and blame the creators for misusing freedom of speech when you are doing the same. i think the radicals were just WAITING for something to happen so they could start fighting with people, because as someone pointed out, the original showing of muhammed was in July of 2001, just two months before 9-11. since then, we've had to cater to everyones feelings and sensitivities. I say no more. we've lived on this earth for HOW LONG before these radicals decided to blow smoke? i mean, c'mon! i think the whole thing is ridiculous and if the extremists wont tolerate certain things, then we non-extremists shouldnt either. I dont see them posting their address on their article.\n\nI'm a fan of south park from the beginning. There was an episode when they showed Muhhamed and nothing happened. Only reason they wont allow the showing is because of post 9/11 prpoganda. I mean this is America. And we are letting people thousands of miles away prevent our right of free speech. They are using fear the same way as they do in their country. And guess what we are letting them win.\n\nChristianity and Islam both have bad track records concerning human rights abuses.\n\nI really think God or any other supreme being is tough enough to take care of him or herself. I do not think the Deity is so fragile people need to kill each other because someone talks bad about someone else's concept of God. Deal with it.\n\nDo we have freedom of speech or not? We should NEVER be afraid to voice our opinion on anything.\n\nMuslim's need to get a grip. South Park makes fun of everyone and every institution. Nothing is sacred in comedy. If South Park had to be worried everytime they were going to be deemed offensive to someone it would be a very short show! It's a US show, protected by free speech and if you don't like it shut the TV off!\n\nWe protect the people that hate us, let them threaten us openly and we do nothing about it.\n\nWow! This controversy will do great things for South Park!\n\nI invite all the non-Muslims to get a copy of Koran and read it. Then maybe it will take away your stereotypes about Muslims \u2013 the stereotypes that are fed by the media. Thanks.\n\nAnd let me add: Your sacred belief may be that your prophet should be depicted. MY sacred belief is that I have the right to say or depict ANYTHING. You follow yours and I will follow mine.\n\nEither everything is on or off the table. Freedom of speech does not come with limitations.\n\nI would recommend that anyone who is horribly offended by this or any other episode of this or any other TV show dig out the owners manual of their television set and locate a feature called the \"off button.\" Use of this feature provides the offended party with a non-violent way to banish the show from their home. What a concept, eh?\n\nEveryone needs to get over this! Episode 200 was great, and deeply disappointed on what they did to Episode 201.\n\nThe main issue I have with all of this is that the website will use Freedom of Speech to defend their threats while trying to silence someone else's right to the same freedom.\n\ni didnt know south park played in other countries...if you dont like the show change the channel. it is a free country!\n\nThat's weird, if the disgust was at Muhammad being portrayed, should it have come when the stick figure was shown? Also, since santa was in the bear suit, shouldn't these complaints be retracted?\n\nNot being completely familiar with everything Islam, I'm wondering if Mohammed himself asked or demanded that his image never be revealed? I wonder what he would say about all this.....just curious.\n\nPosted by: Johann of OC\n\nWhen I watched the Mu....ad episode (Part II) for the first time, I heard the extended beeps during the wrap up/moralistic conclusion, and immediately thought Matt and Trey just played it perfectly. The beeps were overwhelming \u2013 and an obvious way to elevate the importance of what was beeped. In my opinion, they probably weren't confident in the humor or quality of the way it wrapped up \u2013 so they beeped it all out. Funny!\n\nNow, in retrospect, knowing the lawyers confronted Trey and Matt, asking for additional beeps, they probably responded with a 'whew' and proceeded to beep out everything. In the moment, this excessive beeping then became genius \u2013 - forever obscuring an ending that the viewer longs for \u2013 elevating its importance and brilliance.\n\nOk so now we're losing our own freedoms of expression and speech and laughter to the same type violent vengeful threatening ancient people that tried to take just that away from us back on 9/11. It seems they don't even need to use weapons or planes to instill fear on America nowadays. Today I am a shameful American. Where has our backbone and resilience gone? Why are we catering to them now?\n\nLet's see now.... GET OVER IT! Move on. Get a life. Buy a sense of humor. Cope. Go back to your homeland where you can be sensored, improsioned and killed for having an opinion not given to you by a cleric. But...thanks for sharing!\n\nIslam is a religion of peace... under Islam. Mohammed was not a peaceful man as many here seem to think. He married rich, so he didn't have to work, and spent all his time in a cave where God came and spoke to him. He preached his monotheistic beliefs in Mecca to what was then a polytheistic society, and was driven out of town for it. He came back with an army of followers who believed his teachings, and he was kicking ass and taking names.\n\nIslam is a religion of intolerance. Intolerance for anyone and anything that is out of line with their beliefs. Ironically, since 9/11, muslims the world over have been playing the victim, and politically correct sensitivity has gone off the deep end.\n\nThey attacked Scientology and Mormanism a lot worse than Islam. And what about Gingers? And segueway riders? And the list goes on. That's what its all about. But if you watch the show \u2013 at the end, one of the kids always has a 'lessons' learned that when you actually listen to it \u2013 is spot on. But Seth, you sound a bit angry and hostile. Even threatening. Why do you assume 50% of the commenters are atheists?\n\nI am thoroughly asamed and embarassed for my people. I watch South Park, and I was really excited to see what I look like. Even I'M not allowed to see myself!! Do you know how frustrating that is? I could have a booger hanging out of my nose, but I can't even look in a mirror to see it! What if my towel is crooked? Suppose I have seaman in my chin? I can't take it anymore!!! Aaaaaaaah!\n\nPosted by: Mohammad the Prophet\n\nSeth South Park did not commit a terrible crime and Islam and Muslims are evil and deserve to be made fun of.\n\nActually, BECAUSE you disagree makes it 100% okayt. That is the essence of free speech. Dissent is very American.\n\n..and all these \"outraged\" people were nowhere to be found when South Park spent an entire episode mocking Mormonism (where they had a song chanting \"Dumb-dumb-dumb\" whenver the LDS belief system was discussed) or the SEVERAL episodes that have made fun of Scientology.\n\nOne group should NEVER be above ridicule. That was the whole point of the two episiodes.\n\nIf the Prophet Mohammed isn't supposed to be depicted in any physical form, then I'm certain devout Muslims don't do it. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are not Muslims, so just as athiests speak negatively of Jesus Christ, and Evangelicals refer to Catholics as satan spawn, they have the right to depict Mohammed wearing a bear suit (I didn't see the episode myself.) People should concern themselves with their own behavior in respect to their beliefs, and *nobody* should concern themselves with others' spiritual beliefs.\n\nEveryone has a different path to the divine, whether they are Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Spaghetti Monsterism, etc., and anybody who is a true follower of any religion would be accepting of any other. I'm certain that's what Jesus would teach, what Mohammed would teach, what Buddha would teach, etc. were they alive today.\n\nToo many simple-minded fools in the world today.\n\nok you are all missing the point here....how do you think Tom Cruise feels? You sure don't hear him complaining and he was bashed waaaay more than muhhamed. Come on! he had Seaman on his back! who cares about a bear suit!\n\nTo the person above who stated that South Park is tarnishing the image of Islam.....do you REALLY think that South Park is the biggest thing in this world that is tarnishing the Islamic image??? Maybe the tarnishing is coming from....oh, I don't know...maybe it's due to the complete willingness of self purported Muslims to blow up 100 fellow Muslims in order to kill one non Muslim in a crowded square or strapping a 100 pounds of TNT to a donkey and sending it amongst a crowd or maybe back-packing explosives on a brain washed child or a mentally challenged person. Maybe THOSE things are what tarnishes the supposedly \"peaceful\" position of Islam. Until the \"peaceful\" Muslims quit burying their heads in the sand while their violent Muslim counterparts tarnish their religion, then they have no right expecting the rest of the world to see them as the peace loving people they evidently are not.\n\nJust get over it. South Park has made fun of my God left and right, but that does not change who Gid is. The South Park guys will be the ones in trouble for sinning against God, not I. The sanctity my God does not depend on whether idiots show reverence or not. It cannot be affected by anything because God himself is already holy. Can Muslims be more confident of their faith?\n\nShould of just had a disclaimer. If you are Muslim then do not watch this episode! Not every one is Muslim and you cant expect everyone to follow the Muslim religon just because a group of people do. People should be aloud to live and express their own lives for themselves and if there is a God then he/she/it should be the judge when the time comes. South Park did nothing wrong (unless your Muslim) and Im truley upset that Comedy Central laid down for a group of extremist.\n\nTypical Muslim responce show a picture of Mohammed and we'll kill you. Get a life and a sense of humor. My Lord and Savior and God have all been made fun of over the years and yet do we see Christians going out and killing over this no. Get a sense of humor.\n\nNever mind, if you feel so offended by what you're watching, don't watch it. God said we got free will for a reason, and that means if you don't like something, don't watch it...no one is forcing you.\n\nDid no one actually pay attention to what else was going on in the episode? TO MUSLIM FANS OF SOUTH PARK: You CAN NOT laugh at a mocking depiction of Jesus, Buddha, or any other \"religious figure\" and then be so hypocritical as to become offended when the tables are turned. The point of this episode was NOT to isolate and humiliate Muslims, rather the idea that they are above criticism. Besides, regardless of your beliefs, who are you to condone violence against another? Let God decide how to handle them.\n\nThis is flat out ridiculous! I commend the South Park Boys for inciting this debate and bringing to light the absolute stupidity of the whole event.\n\nwhy was there no uproar in 2001 when they actually SHOWED Mohammed, what has happened in 9 years that all of the sudden sparks such outrage on the part of so called Muslims.\n\nSouth Park by its very nature is deeply satirical. If someone is offended by any one of its episodes, then chances are you won't like the rest. So don't watch it.\n\nDoesn't mean you should want to ban it. Its not promoting hatred, its breaking taboos of what's considered 'holy'. That's not a crime. In my book, that's a good thing.\n\n\"Many groups will use these excuses to hire more people to work against western interest.\"\n\nUntil that doesn't make me I'm not too concerned. Since that'll always make me , I'll always be not too concerned.\n\nHow much will they be paying btw?...\n\n\"What these cartoonist are trying to do is tarnish the image of Islam and it wont work\" \u2013 You're right, Muslim extremists are doing a good enough job of that themselves.\n\nYou people didnt watch the show...it WAS NOT Mohammad...it was Santa. Intolerant people should at least try to understand the topic before they pick up their guns.\n\nHow can you publish this as serious when you don't even mention that Muhammad was never in the bear costume? It was Santa Claus!\n\nI agree with William...we are letting these fanatics win. This is the United States. We have free speech. If you have chosen to be here then you have chosen to accept the rules of the game. Here's a thought...you can just turn the channel. Those of this violent fanatical religion who want to destroy, burn, riot, murder, and terrorize this country because we actually have freedom, I leave you with this thought. We as American will allow you your folly for only so long. At some stage when we have had enough of your violent religious based crap you will see a very bright light in that part of the world followed by a mushroom cloud. Sad but as these people continue to try to exercise their domination of other countires...it may come to that.\n\nI'm glad to see that primitive, ignorant barbarism is still alive and well in the modern world. Keep up the good fight against those who would dare speak their minds and offend you!\n\nI will help them end this debate. America is a free country. End of story.\n\nWhy not just get rid of Islam, Christians, all religions and bad cartoons like south-park the world will be better off.\n\nI completely agree with MuckRaker's remark. I don't remember any riots back in '01 when they showed \"the prophet.\"\n\nPosted by: Super Best Friends\n\nWhy do the so called \"moderate\" muslims never raise their voice against Islamic extremism? Why do they let the radicals taint their religion in barbaric violence? This should all be sorted out within the Muslim community. Muslims who live in North America and Europe enjoy the freedom to practice their religion and other social freedoms as well. Why do so many in turn cry out against the \"evil\" western society while enjoying our freedom? If they want to live in a homogeneous muslim culture then they should be living in Arabia and not in democratic countries. I'm proud to live in a society where I can freely cry out against all religions if I wanted to. I should be able to criticize any religion, institution, philosophy and scientific theories that exist in this world. I do not need any institution to tell me what I should believe in. It's time for the moderate muslims to do some serious PR work on behalf of their religion. It would also be nice if people in general developed a better understanding of satirical humour and had a laugh every now and then.\n\nI am sure that in the past muslim cartoonists have made sketches of jesus and of other religious deieties who are not muslim and everyone laughed about it. I sure can't remember a case where muslims have been critisized about doing something like this. Why? Because the people of other religions understand that everyone has a right to free speedh no matter how distastful an image can be and they know that this is more important than getting angry at what one reads or sees.\n\nWhat these show creators are trying show is the ridiculous ideas these belief system instill into its followers. South park has made fun of the other abrahamic religions for their ridiculous quircks. This episode of south park is just trying to get to the heart of islams ridiculous quirk of not showing mohammed.\n\nDo people understand satire? When are we as humans going to get over being offended by opinions People say offensive things to everyone. It's how you react that makes you better or worse. We live in a world where freedom of speech needs to be fought for more than ever. Lighten up and learn to laugh.\n\nI get sick of people being offended by everything if it doesn't hurt you or your loved ones suck it up. Nobody cares about your id letting everyone know how childish you are and how every word hurts your feelings and this goes for every religion, if your gods are so great why did he create such weak followers?\n\nComedy Central took away my freedoms by censoring the episode and made each of us who truly love the show a victim of terrorism by not airing it uncensored. The constant bleeps throughout the show ruined my high.\n\nWOW! Can't believe so much controversy over a cartoon. Goes to show how ignorant people are. It's a comedy driven show based on overinflating and overexploiting everything in order to push the limits. They do this to gain viewers. If people don't like it, don't watch. Anyway, this has all been done already in the 80's. Don't you remember the Smurfs? Gargamell represented the devil, Joker smurf represented the Catholics cause he always liked to \"joke around\", Smurfet represented the Jews cause she would never give it up, and pappa smurf represented the Muslims, nice beard.....hahahahha wow!\n\nPosted by: why do we argue about religon when no one knows until you die, seems pointless to argue about something you don't really know about until you kick the bucket...LOL\n\nI think everyone who is so riled up either way just needs to get a life and realize THIS IS A CARTOON...if religion is such a big part of your life and a SATORICAL TELEVISION show offended you so badly, whether your Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or whatever, DON'T WATCH IT. CHANGE THE CHANNEL. No one is forcing you to watch it. It's not like this egregious insult was shown in schools or delivered to you at your places of worship, IT'S A CARTOON. Get over yourselves\n\nthis is a serious element to muslim doctrine, huh? great religion. real powerful and spiritual\n\nMuslims, really, get serious here. I don't think Mohammed would mind a joke or two, He was after all your swash-buckling hero/scourge of the sands. Come on get real. I think you guys are miss-interpreting the no images thing. I think he had that rule while he was alive so his enemies did not know what he looked like. Kind of a self preservation thing. Remember there wasn't exactly cameras or the internet then. To hide one's self you made sure no one drew your picture. The seriousness of the scripture was to instill fear and obedience. I think it's high time to get over yourselves and lighten up.\n\nTime for another crusade! If the muslims can't live in our country by the rules that exist, fine. Go somewhere else. Free speech says everyone is fair game in our country. Lots of places in the middle east which welcome muslims and their way of life. Go nuts. Stop causing trouble here, or trouble is what you're going to get.\n\nPerhaps this is a task for homegrown viral video. If a good number of people would create You Tube videos and movies featuring mohammed and they could be spread around, who would the extremists turn to in order to vent? They would be awash in images of the prophet. Would they retreat from the web if they could not know where such an image might pop up?\n\nI have a question. If no one has been allowed to draw a picture of Mohammed *gasp* then how does anyone know what he looks like? I could draw a picture of a man looking NOTHING like Mohammed actually did (as no one can possibly know what he actually looked like, see before) and that would piss muslims off? WTF. Grow up children.\n\nFirst, let me say that I do not like South Park and have not seen an entire episode of it. That being said, I know what South Park is about and what they depict on their show-that is why I choose not to watch it-I do not find it humorous to make fun of anyones belief or handicaps. To be insulted by this episode means that you watched it-if it is offensive to you, don't watch,. I have seen comments saying that they think South Park is very funny-up until this episode which made fun of something that they hold sacred. So watching when they made fun of other religions/politics...etc was OK. If you don't like it, turn it off but you are living in the US and we have freedom of speech so you will need to come to terms with that. No one is forcing you to watch South Park. I know I sure don't.\n\nI must have missed the Muslims condemning the violent reactions and death threats to that cartoonist. I'm sure he was convincing.\n\n@77, Stone and Parker don't make fun of religion just because they don't believe in it. They do it because it is relevant, controversial, and they can make it funny while teaching the world a lesson about tolerance and being open-minded.\n\nThey bash on every religion, every celebrity, every aspect of life as we know it, and it's all in good humor and fun. There is absolutely no malicious intent and if you take it that way, says more about you than them.\n\nI understand that South Park can be offensive, but it's offensive to you, and you, and you. No one is left out so it's not pointing fingers at anyone. Get over yourselves.\n\nCheck out the revolutionislam site now, haha\n\n\"You people didnt watch the show...it WAS NOT Mohammad...it was Santa. Intolerant people should at least try to understand the topic before they pick up their guns.\"\n\nAnd you didn't watch the first part epidose where the dressed up was WAS suppoed to be Mohammad, which is what got everyone freaking out in the first place.\n\nAmericans make fun of everything. If we hate something, we joke about it, if we love something, we joke about it. Sarcasm and our way of laughing at the world, no matter how sacred, is probably misunderstood in many parts of the world. If a group of people gets mad about our jokes, we will joke about that as well. South Park, for all its bad language and insulting behavior, generally has a message of tolerance.\n\nOh my Dog... this is hilarious. First of all, Muslims watch \"South Park\"? Where is the irony in that?\n\nWhat happened to respect and mutual understanding? That stopped when so-called \"religious\" people decided to kill each other over who's imaginary friend was better.\n\nReligion is evil, and worshiping someone or something is idolatry, and physically harming people \"in the name of\" them is disgusting. THAT is what should be STOPPED.\n\nThe funniest thing is Tom Cruise has see-man on his back! One website makes a terrorist threat against a show, and every other person with an opinion says the show is wrong. Okay, I'm going back to watch South Park's Family guy episode cause it wasn't all that funny and it just keeps telling the same joke. You guys just don't get it. Why don't we figure out who the website is registered to and file a complaint.\n\nFYI, the creators of South Park did not censor the episode, Comedy Central broke contract and censored it themselves.\n\nRadical and/or overly-sensitive Muslims: If you're choking on the sweet air of freedom here in the USA, then you know where you can go. There are plenty of Muslim countries that do not allow satire, ridicule, or even just plain comedy in regard to your beliefs.\n\nIt is rather upsetting that someon can watch South Park and laugh at jokes making fun of every other culture, religion, and creed, but when it comes to their own they are outraged. That is simply racism in its most basic definition.\n\nThe only things these radicals can do is make their own comeback cartoon against the South Park guys...And I'm sure it'll be a real knee-slapper.\n\nThere is something wrong with people that can't take a joke or laugh at themselves!!!\n\nWay to go South Park, it was a great episode! And who would have known Santa would cause so much trouble in that bear costume. lol\n\nI know from my gut that the world will be islamized one day. (I came from third world country where muslims are rewarded with middle-east oil money for marrying non-muslim girls, converting them to islam, and making as many babies as their bodies physically can.) But I also know that there will not be peace even when everyone is muslim. (Look at Sunnis and Shiites, killing each other) Islam was born from violence. Violence will never end as long as islam exists.\n\nI am a die hard South Park Fan but if you know that there are a certain group of folks in the world who can't take a joke......and who are ultra-sensitive about an issue...why needle them?\n\nJust as people are getting so offended by the show, they prove the show is right. Muslims get offended when anyone says anything about their religion. There\u2019s no one mentioning that they had Buddha snorting cocaine in the show. South Park makes fun of EVERYONE.\n\nAnd for people who say they brought back an old issue they already covered ... the entire episode was bringing back old topics covered.\n\nI have a question for Muslims, South park has made fun of every religion in the world, if they missed one it won't before they do. Now the question is What makes you so dang special you are exempt for being poked fun at? You don't see Jews or Christians threatening to kill people call all the times south park has cracked fun at them.\n\nJust when we thought we were getting away from the \"politically correct\"era of the 90's; here we go again!\n\nIt seems that many Muslims need to get some confidence. They have learned and been taught fear for so long its endemic. I feel sorry for you brothers.\n\nIf an object does not bend then it breaks and it's called tolerance. My muslim fellows try to develop some tolerrance into your system. It the key to peace and happiness.\n\ni grew up muslim, and was always uncomfortable with this no-criticism-at-all policy in Islam... i renounced Islam for a lot of reasons, not the least of which was this one... and of course, the murderous atttitudes of islam, its adherents and its prophet toward all dissenters.\n\nmore power to south park!\n\nWhy should one group get to play by different rules than the rest of us? It's sickening.\n\nPosted by: South Park fan\n\nI believe that all you people angry should grow up and get over it. It is not that important or big of a deal. South Park makes fun of everyone and muslims should not be excluded. Thank you.\n\n@Seth In response to your comment \u201cjust because you don't agree with the ideologies of some religions does not make it right for you to go ahead and violate there [sic] most sacred beliefs\u201d:\n\nIf one were to follow that to its logical conclusion, I should not eat pork because that would violate Jewish law, I should not drink alcohol because that would violate Mormon teaching, I should not cut my hair because that violates Sikh tradition . . the list could go on forever.\n\nThe point a lot of posters are trying to make, I think, is that if it goes against Islam for its followers to depict the prophet, fine \u2013 then they should not. As far as I know, Matt & Trey are not Muslim, so there is no requirement that they follow this Islamic tenet. End of story.\n\nSouth Park didn't portray Mohammed. South Park protrayed a teddy bear and CALLED it Mohammed.\n\nPeople seem to mistake what free speech really means. It means that you are free to say/express whatever you like, no matter how offensive. However, it does not guarantee the right to have a television forum to make those statements/expressions. I can say, all purple people are disgusting and should be killed. That doesn't mean comedy central has to supply me with a forum to air those views. Moderate muslims should keep doing what they're doing... if they're offended by something, protest peacefully and boycott (the power of speech and the pocketbook often get noticed, especially if 1.2 billion people are offended). And I don't see anything wrong with those tactics, cause they are in themselves expression of free speech.\n\nI'm a Muslim who has never been a fan of South Park. What I don't understand is why it's necessary to mock any religion or any group of people. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I'd like to see a little more respect in the world.\n\nMuslims need to \"lighten up\". They seem to have absolutely no sense of humor...but a great sense of do as I say \"or else\"....\n\nComedy Central you caved in and missed the whole point of the episode. Every other religion is fair game for satire but not Islam? You caved in to despotic, terrorist threats. This is the USA where free speech reigns- except on Comedy Central.\n\nI'm glad some moderate and reform muslim are willing to speak out against extremism, anti-zionism and anti-semitism but the vast majority of the Muslim world are still living in dark age.It siads that \"it should be a wake up call to Muslims around the world about how they are being portrayed, and instead of grunting and calling for boycotts and other actions, \u201cthey should begin by respecting free speech\u201d and they should ask themselves, \"why?\"Look at any other religion. Do you think majority of Catholics will call for religious edict against Dan Brown? If Salman Rushdie would have visit a Muslim nation what will happened to him as compare to Dan Brown?The vast majority of Muslim has nobody to blame but their clerics and among themselves who promotes radicalism and extremism wihthin the Islamic world. When are Muslim world moving towards enlightenment age like Jews and christian before them?\n\nIf only religion did not exist.\n\nCan someone explain to me why the Muslims do not object to images of Jesus even though they consider him a prophet as they do Mohammed?"], "summary": ["It took seven minutes of a \"South Park\" episode to change a devout Muslim\u2019s features from an entertained smile to complete disapproval. He told his colleague, Lebanese blogger Bilal el-Houri, as he walked away from the screening, \u201cThis is disgusting."]}, {"title": ["CNN Political Ticker: All politics, all the time Blog Archive"], "text": ["How can literate Americans like the posters on this blog be so completely ignorant of the Constitution?\n\nThe Constitution does NOT say you can build a mosque anywhere you want, or anything like it. It says \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n\nSo, firstly, Congress is not even involved in this matter. Secondly, the City of New York has the legal authority to zone its property however it wants. Thirdly, this thing isn't even a mosque \u2013 it's an \"islamic center,\" whatever that is.\n\nSo you Islamo-fascist apologists should stop waving OUR Constitution around and distorting its meaning. Liberals do enough damage to the Constitution already.\n\nwhats abberant here is ignorants has lead these people to fight the mosk in the trianglur trade from africa the ships were.in the name of jesus and.mary and love it has a positive look the guild there true.reality why not read abiut islam why speak ill of islam when.u.dobt even.know what prophet mohammed preached islam has extremist just like every other religion. how many muslims died in 9/11 a sane muslim would hate these criminals who.use the name of mohammed to\n\nYes it a slap in the face. Osama Bin Laden is muslim and he was the one who attacked us so why would we want a mosque on ground zero. Our people died that day due to a muslim. It's an insult to all those people who died and the soldiers out there fighting for us. SAY NO TO THE MOSQUE!!!!!!\n\nVery unfortunately, ONLY in Islam, MOSQUES are USED to preach hatred against civilized non-muslims. That is exactly what happened to Bin Laden. He followed the teachings of a IMAM. I have nothing against fellow muslims, as long as they only use a MOSQUE for prayers.\n\nOthers are not wrong in stating that Islam teaches violence, because, you can hear that in mosques in Palestine, Saudi Arabia ( during Hajj!!!), Pakistan (almost all mosques in Peshawar), mosques in Kashmir. Please stop using mosques to provoke muslims.\n\nThis has nothing to do with freedom to practice one's religion, it has everything to do with sensitivity to the families and the memory of the victims. The more the Muslim community shows it's insensitivity the more it will hurt their image. It's their Public Relations nightmare, let them deal with it. If we don't like the end result, the cost of the damage control they'll have to do will far outstrip the cost of building a mosque on this controversial site.\n\nI seem to remember a section of President Obama's \"Oath of Office\" that referred to, and I'm paraphasing here, \"...uphold the Constitution of the United States of America think Chief Justice Roberts go that part right at least. Doesn't that same Constitution give religious freedom to ALL Americans..or has the GOP comandeered that section as well? What the President was doing was enforcing the Constitution\u2013just what he PROMISED UNDER OATH to do. There is a huge difference between legal right and moral wishes. Please don't confuse the two!\n\nAlso, it's not like they are building a mosque ON Ground Zero. It is two blocks away. This shouldn't even be an issue.\n\nJohn, you think Muslims are evil. That's the crux of your opposition. You just won't say it. Bigot.\n\nThis is about sentiments, if the promoters of this project aim at fostering inter religious tolerance, they are not acheiving much.\n\nIf our \"Christian Religion\" was so perfect, then why did we have a \"Protestant\" rebellion in practically all the countries of the world? And now, it is the same \"Christian Believers\" that wish to deny another religion the right to practice their beliefs. Extortion within the \"Catholic Church\" and the taking of hundreds of thousands of innocent peoples lives simply because they did not agree with the policies of the Church. When is America going to wake up and acknowledge that we are made up of many different cultures and religions!\n\nWe are killing there people (Muslims) everyday. We are invading their (Muslim) countries and killing their (Muslims) women, children \u2013 it is OK since they are not our people.\n\nAl-Qaida killed 3,000 people and they are not all American. We can not blame Islam for this \u2013 it will be wrong. Who killed more people (Hitler, Mussolini, and Bush) and we should not blame Christianity for this?\n\nWe should not oppose Mosque near World Trade Center. We can not blame entire Muslim American for some of Muslims? \u2013 Islam does not support killing innocent people.\n\nWell Li, unfortunately for you poorly thought out comments \u2013 you conveniently overlooked the modern murderes of abortion doctors. And it doesn't matter the time frame, the point is that simply because one person or a group of people does something in the name of a religion that should not be used as basis to judge the entire religion.\n\nHere's a few facts for you: muslims also follow the ten commandments. During the middle ages, while Europeans were mostly ignorant pig farmers, the muslims built the greatest civilization of their time in Persia and were the pinnacle of sciences and the arts. The Bible also says its ok to kills non-believers in the name of God \u2013 check out Deut 20:10-18. As far what you said about one of the most respected religous figures in the world \u2013 I'm not going to even deign that with a reply.\n\n\"King said 'the attack was carried out in the name of Islam,'\"\n\nSeriously? That's his argument for opposing the mosque?\n\nThe Crusades were carried out in the name of Christianity. The Inquisition was carried out in the name of the Catholic Church. The Old Testament is nothing but violence and killing carried out in the name of God. And on and on and on and on.\n\nSo by King's logic, there should be no religious places of worship built anywhere.\n\nCome to think of it, I'm all for that.\n\nF'in Republicans. Won't vote for helping responders b/c they are blocked from adding irrelavent ammendments, now they say it's justifiable to suppress a religion b/c they killed in the name of God. Well if that's why a religion should be suppressed, then it would be just as justifiable to close every fricken Christian church and Jewish Synagogue in the country given how many Christians and Jews have murdered in the name of the same God Islam worships, just under a different alias.\n\nMuch is done in the name of Christianity and Islam that is inconsitent with those faiths.\n\nWhile you can excerpt from the Bible or the Koran to justify almost any perspective, the common message of Christ and Mohammad was one of tolerance, inclusion and compassion. At the end of the day, the fundamental context at the heart of Christ\u2019s teachings can be summed in the phrase \u201cLove One Another\u201d just as the underlying message in Mohammad\u2019s teachings exhorted people to work together from a context of Community \u2013 and Mohammad explicitly included people of the Christian and Jewish faiths in his Community of Islam. If your choices and actions don\u2019t say \u201cLove One Another\u201d, you might call yourself a Christian, but you aren\u2019t BEING a Christian any more than Muslims who\u2019s actions fail to create community are truly being a follower of Mohammad. In their narrow, intolerant sense of morality, socially conservative Christians have much in common with the Taliban.\n\nAnyone and I mean ANYONE who opposes this is guilty of ignorance and racism. You can sugar coat it all you want but that is what it is. To so totally ignore our history is disgusting. Our culture is based on FREEDOM and SELF DETERMINATION. Not hatred and intolerance but so many in America are.\n\nThe Oklahoma City bombing was done by Christians in the name of Christianity. Would the people objecting to the Mosque in NYC also object to a church being built on the OKC site?\n\nThat's it, get rid of every single Christian church in this country. After all, if we must hold all Muslims and the religion of Islam accountable for anything done in the name of Allah or Islam and limit their religious freedoms, we must hold every Christian and every Christian denomination accountable for every heinous act and war carried out in the name of Jesus and/or Christianity.\n\nFor goodness sack, let these people build their mosque!\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Muslims around the world are good people who would never commit an act of terrorism. It's just the one small segment of the religion, like in any religion, are extremists and they are getting all the attention. Our country was founded on the principle of religious freedom, and that includes Islam. If we deny these people the right to build their mosque but would Ok it if someone wanted to build a church or other place of worship, then in essence we are almost as bad as the terrorists.\n\nI am really shocked that the vast majority of 9/11 families are opposed to it, according to this article. The people who are building the Mosque, had nothing to do with the people who attacked the WTC. Equating the two would be like saying that all Christians are part of the Klu Klux Klan so they shouldn't be allowed to build a church. It's just silly and un-American.\n\nI hardly ever read comments on these one side forums, but I could help notice the fine print when you submit the comment which is as follow:\n\nComments are moderated by CNN, in accordance with the CNN Comment Policy, and may not appear on this blog until they have been reviewed and deemed appropriate for posting. Also, due to the volume of comments we receive, not all comments will be posted.\n\nThere is no question that CNN is Anti-Islam media outlet, which is why it is obvious that hardly any pro Islamic comment is seen. I have a question: Was Adolf Hitler Muslim? Supposedly he killed lots of Jews..\n\nwhats abberant here is ignorants has lead these people to fight the mosk in the trianglur trade from africa to spain to\n\nAnd the Salem Witch tortures and murders were carried out in the name of Christianity. So shall we ban all churches from Salem?\n\nThis mosque is a slap in the face to all who have died Fighting terroists. To even bring this up is an insult to the USA. We are still fighting and they want to build on ground ZERO. WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE THINKING ????????????\n\nJohn: IIRC Mecca isn't in America.\n\nDo you protect the Constitution or not?\n\nYe, like it was the Christain Church that sanctioned black Africns to be enslaved. Should Blacks boycott Christainity and its tenets?\n\nThis whole mess is highlighting the poor thinking skills of Americans. We're still blaming 9/11 on a religion instead of extremists. The terrorists have won this oart of the battle... and it's really sad.\n\nFor someone to seriously assume that the people who flew planes into the towers were doing in on behalf of ALL of Islam is just plain insanity. There is not a religion in the world that does not have its extremists, and Islam is no exception. We Christians have done our share of pointless killing as well. This predisposition that this country is beginning to have of blaming \"those people\" for all our woes is getting dangerously close to sounding like misbegotten beliefs of past cultures of hate. We must step very, very carefully here.\n\nAll that being said, I think it is extremely insensitive for the developers and mosque leadership to want a mosque near the site of the disaster. Certainly there are other sites that would work just as well, and not create such a fervor. I would guess that, if in fact this mosque is ever actually built, it will be the target of vandalism, fires, and hate crimes. It's a bad thing all around.\n\nwhat's abberant is when individuals are against islam out if ignorants islams main message is to abrogate the law of moses and jesus the\n\nUSA IS A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY AND NOT MUSLIM OR JEWISH!\n\nThere are enough mosques and synagogues in NYC... enough! We do NOT need another Islamic Center & Mosque!\n\nWould they allow us to build churches in Saudi Arabia or other strict muslim countries? NO WAY, you'll get killed by even talking about other religion! ENOUGH BEING BRAIN WASHED!\n\nReasonably, building a mosque near ground zero can send avery positve message that Islam also mourns 9-11. We should go ahead and build worship centres of other faiths too.\n\nBut why be reasonable when we can be irrationally driven by hatred fed by our prejudices and capitalize on fear and bigotry!\n\nObama is very reasonable but, thanks to the irrationality of so many US citizens, may have made a bad political move. Only shows his integrity. But who cares about that? Palin, etc. cater to bigots much more!\n\nThe Constitution is outdated and outmoded in todays world and each amendment should be revised to apply to todays world, not something that was written two hundred years ago that may have applied to the world at that time. Each amendment should be looked at and changed if necessary. Types of guns then, and types of guns today, immigration laws then and how it would apply to today. It's badly outdated and should be changed.\n\nSen. Santorum made the best argument for sensitivity: What if a church that preached \"racial separation and that MLK's death was his fault\" wanted to build a church at the site MLK was murdered? Would it be legal and constitutional? Yes. Would it be insensitive, painful and in bad taste? Yes. And that is exactly what building a mosque at Ground Zero feels like. It is grossly insensitive, will bring pain to so many and it is just plain wrong. I am astounded that our president and other leaders can be so insensitive.\n\nYes, building this mosque so close to ground zero IS in bad taste. BUT...the New York city authorities have all signed off on this, and more importantly, people get to choose where they can worship in this country (unless it is an imminent public hazard...for example you cannot hold a religious service in th middle of an interstate highway). To say differently means you are for the sort of restrictions against Christian and Jewish worship that are common in Arab countries. I thought we were better than those countries, right wingers?\n\nAnd to those who say this mosque might well be an \"imminent public hazard\" as it will harbor terrorists...you could be right. But I agree with John: Let 'em have their mosque but keep it in under constant, and complete, surveillance. (And not just by the CIA and FBI...I would hope the far-right would do more than complain on the internet about the mosque and, organize massive pickets in front of it. I'm talking 24/7/365 protesting. Or are you all too fat and rich to do that sort of thing?)\n\nReply to ad. And what do you call the Inman in charge of this project? As far as I'm concerned he should be sitting in Gitmo, not erecting a mosque by Ground Zero.\n\nAnd by the way the Aryan Nations do have a church, it's called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian. The Aryan Nations sprang from this church. They seem to have the same views as Muslims concerning people of the Jewish faith. So where is the hate really?\n\nWhy has no one mentioned that if the Mosque is built the city will no longer get any property tax from that land? And just how much tax money per year is being given up. So in effect, the city of New York will be subsidizing this Mosque with the loss of public money.\n\nKings logic = any violence done in the name of a relgion should mean the religion is to blame. I guess he hates Christians a real lot.\n\nKing's logic is flawed and designed to appeal to his constituent's fear and paranoia. It's a cynical and destructive way to get votes. Many crimes are carried out \"in the name\" of one thing or another, but that doesn't make the connection legitimate. In fact, Al Qaeda membership represents less than 1% of the total number of Muslims on the planet. Furthermore, by allowing the Islamic center to be built, it demonstrates that Islam is not the enemy of the United States, therefore young Muslims will have one less reason to join Al Qaeda and other anti-west sects. Aside from being consistent with our own constitution, it is intelligent strategy to embrace moderate Muslims whenever we can. There is no rational reason for not the allowing the construction of this center.\n\nHow about they reopen the investigation on 911 so that all Americans can see that it was executed with the assistance of the CIA all so they could get soldiers in Afghanistan to try to reclaim their hold on the drug trade there. Alqeada had declared war on the CIA becuase they got tired of giving the CIA money after they were created to run the CIA drug business there. The CIA was unable to assasinate Alqeada so they needed us army to help. This is why the trade center was targeted its the CIA HQ. Now note Alqeada did attack us, but the CIA assisted them ot make sure the outcome was catastrophic, anything less would not lead to war.\n\nWhat Union contractor or workers are going to build it?\n\nEnjoy your Victory mosque!! and the hundreds more being built all over the USA.\n\nI thought that the president was very clear with his original remarks, and with his follow up comments, which were entirely consistent with each other. Nowhere did he \"support\" the building of a mosque near ground zero \u2013 he supported the right to build it.\n\nBuilding a mosque close to ground zero may be unwise, but there seems to be a sentiment that it should also be unlawful. The president was simply making it clear that making it unlawful would would be fundamentally against your constitution.\n\nyep thats a trade in tollerance \u2013\n\nlet the muslims build there mosque -right on ground zero\n\nthat they show how tollerant of tother trreligions they are by allowing the hebrew temple to be built on the temple mount by the dome of the rock :}:}:} ........\n\nYou know I never heard of young boys getting molested at a muslem church and you don't hear about little girls being raped by muslem preachers. I do hear these atrocities from the Christian church. And the Christians will tell you that your going to hell unless you only believe in their god. We can also go back to the Salem witch trials and the Crusades and it makes what the muslems do seem like childs play. In the end you will all see that there is one God and weather you choose to call him mohamed or Jesus you will reap what you have sewn with your fellow human being.\n\nHi ho hiho off to work we go.. seems stressful times calls on us to grow. .. great news.. Ok so now lets blame the KKK for all the wrongs in done in the name of Christ. Relax an unfold america\n\nIt's known without a doubt that most Muslims are peace loving people tolerant of other people and their religions. That is why it is clear that the people behind wanting to build this mosque fall into a minority group of Muslims that are not peace loving and tolerant. If these particular Muslims were acting in the spirit of peace, love and tolerance they would build this Mosque further away from ground zero where the majority of America would not take offense to it. Therefore, the only reason the people building this mosque insist on their legal right to do so is because they are acting in Anger, Hate and Intolerance. They know it serves as shrine to the Radical Muslim Terrorist who brought down the twin towers and at heart because they see these people as heroes and the shrine to their gods soldiers must be built.\n\nWhat he doesn't seem to understand when he thinks these attacks were \"carried out in the name of Islam\" is that this does not encompass the whole religion. There are tons of Christians as well who hide their political beliefs and discrimination by saying it's carried out in the name of Christianity. This isn't about religion so much as it is about politics. 9/11 happened because of politics, not religion. It was a political agenda that was shown. Religion itself is very peaceful. People who skew religion to justify their political beliefs are not real religious people. Christianity and Islam are both very peaceful religions. We can not look at one instance and say that THIS is what muslims do. Neither can we say that just because a bunch of priests molested Children, that this is what Christianity is about either.\n\nThe religions are NOT about these things.\n\nIt's really pathetic and disappointing that people in this country are so blinded by their ignorance. The fact is that Obama and all the people, including myself, that support the mosque being built are right and those against it are wrong. Read the constitution. Learn the constitution. It's a big part of why people love this country and are so patriotic. If you don't like it then leave this country. Plain and simple.\n\nBy the way I am a 21 year old third generation Lebanese and my family is Christian.\n\nif america allows this mosque to be built by its attackers religion -on sacred ground -\n\nislam should show how tollerant it is of other religions and allow the temple of the herews to be rebuilt next to the dome of the rock ..\n\nthat is a true test of tollerance \u2013 i bet the islamics will fail :} :} :}\n\nIf only people went back into the history of Christianity there would see a war matched that went on for centuries , forced conversions, burning at stakes and what not. .. why not just leave religion alone and deal with the groups involved. Just look at these two guys faces on the picture in the article... so filled with hatred and hard anger....that's not preached in any faith and even any faith may preach violence and hatred , where is our logic and humanity gone?\n\nI've got it ! Let's build a memorial to all those lost Japanese souls lost in Pear Harbor. After all not all the Japanese fought us..This country sucks. It stands for nothing..\n\nAll wars/acts of terrorism are based in some form of religion! King is wrong.\n\nIt may be in bad taste, and many may feel offended, but that's no reason to overrule the Constitution. Today the 1st Amendment protects an unpopular minority. Tomorrow it may protect you.\n\nWhat I want to know is why hasn't something appropriate been built on Ground Zero by now?\n\nI believe it is Gods intention for all religions to come together to know that he is God. Stop the religious hypocrisy in this country.\n\nWhen will Christians start acting like Jesus tells us to act? Oh yes, when we are demanding that others stop worshiping wealth and using violence to get what they want.\n\nCrtitics of the President's support for the Islamic center would be equally outraged, and more justifiably, if he said he opposed it. For opposing and trying to stop the center would mean that the President is actually doing something of which his critics constantly and falsely accuse him: violating the Constitution, in particular, its protection of the freedom of religion.\n\nEither this is a nation of laws or it is not. If it is a nation of laws and the law allows for the center to be built (and it does), then to refuse to allow its construction violates the foundation of this nation. We may not like it, but we must support it.\n\nThis shouldn't even be a question. Of course the Cordoba Center should be built \u2013 not only is it their constitutional right, but there is a Muslim community in Manhattan who are as American as anybody else. This whole issue is being used as propaganda by bigoted knuckleheads.\n\nTax all churches, and other religious institutions, so that they may \"Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's\".\n\nA leader would have strong command of his words both before and after his polls drop. This guys a a lawyer playing it safe. Absolutely not a leader. Obviously a mosque has a legal right to build in a sensitive area, but doing so would defy popular sentiment so much that it would insight violence in wake of it being perceived by many americans as a slap in the face. Islam may not be militant but a ton of islamists are still living in the middle ages and seek to wage holy wars. This cannot be a good decision nor should a leader be so unclear with his message. This is not my president. Absolutely if a mosque pops up, I support a gay bar popping up right next door. After all, they have a legal right to be located next to a mosque as well.\n\nJJ- A lot of 'sensitivity' gets disguised as 'evil' too.. what you you say we go build a cathedral in Mecca, that would go over like a fart in Church!... I am still waiting for the Islamic outrage and public relations spin from the 911. Either our main stream media isn't reporting it or it isn't there, I'm opting for the latter and the mosque is just another show of the viral infection headed our way.\n\nThe topic of taxing churches is a good one, and should be talked about much more. Why should they be exempt, when obviously they are a business just like any other. I worked for two churches, one Baptist and the other Lutheran, and in both cases, the bottom line was always the bottom line. Money talks and Jesus saves.....at First National Bank. Taxes churches of all faiths equally would be a good way to get the country out of debt. Why should they get a free ride while everyone else pays.\n\nMaybe the Constitution needs a complete update and be rewritten since everyone wants it to do what they want it too.\n\nFor those who support the Constitution \u2013 the law allows the mosque to be built. Therefore, elected officials have no Constitutional authority to stop it. We may be opposed to it morally. We may think it is insensitive. We have the right to object, to try to convince, to be angry. But, if we support the Constitution, we must accept that we have no right to prevent the mosque from being built. The Constitution provides for protection from the 'tyranny of the masses', and the whims of government.\n\nIf you think elected officials *should* intervene, and you vote based upon that \u2013 then you are *not* in support of the Constitution. Instead, you are in support of tyranny \u2013 because you are in support of putting officials in place who would oppress any group that the majority don't like. That *is* the definition of tyranny and oppression. I find it distressing that so many who call themselves American cannot see this.\n\nPeople will believe only what they want to believe.\n\nIf you are saying there are no Christian terrorists in 2010, then you are wrong my friend. Open your eyes up. Read up about christian atrocities in north east india and africa. Please do not compare America to third world islamic nations. If you really want to compare, then please compare 3rd world islamic nations with 3rd world christian nations.\n\nNadler is right Al-Queda attacked us, not the entire Muslim world!! Where is Osama Bin Laden? STILL can't find him Hmmmm? Why isn't the NEW WTC construction taking SOOOO long, will the Mosque be completed first PROBABLY SOOO!! NY CITY CORRUPTION!! Wake UP!\n\nEveryone seems to overlook the fact the of the 3000+ innocent people who lost their lives that day it also included a number of muslim Americans. Those victim's families suffered just as much loss and grief as any other. But because they are muslims they somehow don't count.\n\nBlaming all of Islam for the actions of misguided extremists who commit atrocities in the name of Islam.\n\nOver the years, there have been many delusional, misguided people who have, of their own accord, commited various atrocities in the name of Christianity (I am not talking about the atrocities commited by the Church itself) \u2013 does this mean that their actions were condoned by the Church itself? Does it mean every Christian in the world supports these atrocities? Of course not.\n\nAnyone can stand up and say \"I do this in the name of my religion\" \u2013 it does not mean their religion would supports it.\n\nThe non-Moslem supporters of this mosque make the fundamental error of considering Islam to be a religion just like other religions. In fact, Islam is far more than a religion. It is also an ideology - supremacist, bigoted, aggressive, totalitarian and imperialist. Yusuf Qaradawi (the most influential Muslim cleric in the world today, the spiritual head of the Muslim Brotherhood) says: \"Islam is not a religion in the common, distorted meaning of the word, confining its scope only to the private life of man. By saying that it is a complete way of life, we mean that it caters for all the fields of human existence. In fact, Islam provides guidance for all walks of life \u2014 individual and social, material and moral, economic and political, legal and cultural, national and international.\" Qaradawi is talking about Sharia law which all Moslems are supposed to follow. Sharia law, among other nasty things, requires the legal subordination of non-Moslems and women; it requires the death penalty for apostasy, blasphemy, homosexuality and a host of other sin/crimes. The most popular manual of Sharia law, Umdat al Salik, approved by the highest Islamic authorities of Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egpyt defines jihad this way: \"Jihad means to make war on non-Muslims.\" What could be plainer than that? ISLAM IS NOT A RELIGION LIKE OTHER RELIGIONS.\n\nThis Islamic Center will become a shrine that is visited by Muslims from all over the world to celebrate the killing of 3000 innocent people. The Palestinians partied in the streets when the buildings came down...HOW STUPID IS THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COUNTRY? I am sick of all of this.\n\nI am very proud of the leadership that kept an even focus during all of this histrionic debating. The misinformation on this issue has been startling. People can pray where they see fit and government plays no role in that.\n\nWhat is being said about Muslims is same as people used to say about Germans, and before the the Irish and the Jews. There is always a boogie man in the form of a cultural group coming to get everyone. I wonder how many folks with abbreviated German surnames that were shortened during WWI or WWII to hide their heritage from being labeled the enemy are now leading the charge on this issue. And around and around we go. We are not as original as we think we are.\n\nO, and for all the folks trying to draw parallels to Pearl Harbor, there is a Japanese cultural center less than a mile from Pearl Harbor. It's called the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii. Look it up. I really wish people would do their homework before repeating one liners over and over again.\n\n@Steve..just as you have the common sense to differentiate between Aryan Nations and the Church, you should have the brains to differentiate between the terrorists and the Mosque. This is not a mosque for the terrorists. I am sure there are a lot of churches around the place where Martin Luther King was martyred, apart from the church at the national civil rights museum.\n\nBlind hatred will get us nowhere.\n\nTwo questions that no one is asking. Where did all of money for this Islamic Center come from and why now? Why are the Muslims calling this the Cordoba Initiative? Is it just a coincidence that Cordoba was the first place Muslims built a Mosque on the site of a cathedral that they demolished shortly after their conquest of parts of Spain? Any defense of this project before convincing answers to these questions are offered is evidence of stupidity not open mindedness.\n\nLet them have it. We will have cameras rolling throughout the building. CIA should be handling the security of the building. Every single person that enters or visits this Mosque should be entered into systems and checked against the no-fly list and international warrants. Use it like bait.\n\nboth have good arguments: WOW that is refreshing to say\n\nand well, no shortage of strong opioniated posts here\n\nI understand both representative's points, I do not think an islam center should go so near 9/11 sight\n\nIslam is important is very underrepresented both interms of their national voice and physical presence.\n\nDo I want to hear the call to prayer through out a city like I do in Turkey or London, frankly no. But I understand it is like the church bells on sunday... and in its own way it is pretty, but no I don't. and definately NOT 5 times a day\n\nThere is nothing wrong with clarifying the 14th Amendment towards citizenship. This was not an original law made by the founding fathers. I see no problem to this considering it was made back then in 1868 from the will of the people, and now the will of the people in present day want to be more specific about it. We lose 50 billion+ to illegals every year, and we have lost over 21,000 American lives to illegal immigrants. Please tell the families of those victims that you have no problem with the clarification, and that you intend to pay their share of the 50 billion.\n\n\"As a Christian, I am amazed that there is so much uproar and so much amnesia regarding this issue. Everyone wants the legacy of our forefathers to match their beliefs. If it were suggested that the 2nd amendment be modified to outlaw guns many would go crazy....but it's OK to change the 14th amendment to ban some from becoming citizens.\"\n\nWhat if, for hypothesis sake, the land on which the two world trade towers stood was a private land and acquired by an Islamic group to build a huge community centre which included a mosque. What would be the reaction then??!! Haha.\n\nAs a paid up member, I apologise for these right wingnuts. GOD help us if they ever see power.\n\nPeter,Peter,the little teabag eater.This clown should just stfu.\n\nWe are all at fault...It should be brilliantly crystal clear to all of us that Democrats and Republicans are \" ONE & The SAME\"\n\nWe all need to take the jerseys & caps off and quit making this a two sporting team event. This two party system makes us all look like whiny little children to the rest of the world.\n\nVote & vote & vote some more, until we clear the entire two party congress and administration out. That would provide real hope & change!\n\nResponse to Will: What I think it's TERRIBLY TROUBLING is that When we finally go to war with the Iranians, the American people will have to question what side of the fence their Commander in Chief is truly on.\n\nTo April and Brenda T:\n\nWell Chris, unfortunately for your poorly thought of comment, this is 2010 now here in the U.S. and the rest of the CIVILIZED world. There are no Christian crusades, and Christianity follows the 10 Commandments. They are not true Christians if they kill. You can't say the same for Islam, which if you knew anything about, you'd know that it was started from a sadistic, mass-murdering, pedophile & thief that says it's okay to kill infidels in the name of Allah.\n\nP.S. It's spelled \"inquisition\" and \"native\"\n\nChris \"King said \"the attacks were carried out in the name of Islam.\" In the name of Christ abortion doctors have been murdered, the Inquistion has tortured and burnt at the stake countless innocents, and natvie people have had their cultures obliterated. Its wrong to judge Christianity on these acts, and its wrong to judge Islam on the acts of extremists.\"\n\nThis story is still going on.. These politicians are making a big mistake.... Right or wrong to build it, who knows... This place will become a national place of protest.. Violence will become the answer ... bad move by Obamba to support this and bring the national debate to him....\n\nAll these people who say that its just about the Mosque's location near ground zero and that it has nothing to do with bigotry is a load of horse hockey! Just read the virulent, hate filled rants against muslims made in some of these comments. Its obvious that these people have nothing but loathing and contempt for all muslims everywhere. All over the country, Mosques are being targeted, none of which are even close to ground zero. To insist that bigotry isn't playing a big role in the protest of NYC mosque is to be burying your head in the sand.\n\nWhy do the Republicans hate the Constitution so much? Is it really just a piece of paper to you?\n\nI used to live in Peter King's district. Any nine term congressman like him is nothing more than a money launderer. He takes money that was seized by Washington and distributes it to people and businesses that supported him financially. Sort of the same as the Taliban and the opium trade. So who is he to comment. This money launderer had the same ugly comments when Michael Jackson died. The truth is Obama is right, the freedom to practice or not practice religion is guaranteed by the constitution. But I do question the wisdom and sensitivity of building it down there.\n\nChristianity is about love and peace. Jesus didn't preach war but brought peace even by His own death. Christianity expanded from Jerusalem to the ends of the world by preaching love and peace. True Christians were persecuted and suffered as Jesus did. Ofcourse there are many who did wrong in the name of Chrisitianity. Islam on the other had is about war and submission from the biggining. North Africa (Egypt, Lybia, Algeria ..) were forced to become muslims by the sword ... So I don't see the comparison between the two beliefs\n\nThe Great Mosque of Cordoba placed its importance amongst the Islamic community of Al-Andalus for three centuries. In Cordoba, the capital of Al-Andalus, the Great Mosque was seen as the heart and central focus of the capital\n\ni am Muslim and i do support the mosque 3 blocks a way from ground zero just as i dont have any problem with churches all over Iraq after millions dies because of Oil.\n\nthink positive, you might find a better day forward.\n\nWhy not just put a Japaneese memorial in Pearl Harbor too? History shows, those who win the wars get to write the history books...\n\nIf I say the mosque is IN POOR TASTE....how is that bigoted or a racist statement? How is that spewing hate?? Its an opinion...nothing else....so WHY do you liberals believe everyone who doesn't agree with you is somehow a backwoods racist/bigot/small minded person. For a 'PARTY OF TOLERANCE' You democrats are anything but...\n\nAny resistance to the building of this Islamic center can only be based on an awareness of the threat posed by Islam to Western values and life styles as demonstrated by the behavior of Muslim immigrants in their host nations all accross Europe.\n\nDear Larry, you say resistance to the project can only be based on ignorance and racism? Why can't it be based on something like, oh, say, crippling grief, agonizing emotional trauma, righteous indignation, or just plain ol' American patriotism? You are the one who is ignorant.\n\nObama didn't \"declare his support\". He merely asserted that they have a right to build it; whether they should is an entirely different matter.\n\nThe Muslim Center is on land bought by them and not on Holy Ground. I didn't think and don't think there is such a thing in the first place. Interesting how the right talks about religious freedom and the wants to ignore it here! disgusting and hypocritical as well as being against the Constitution!\n\nThe US Constitution supports it, and the only rebuttal seems to be fear of Islam. I question the opening on the 10th anniversary of the attack, but recognize that it is far more important to uphold the US Constitution and not cave in to the emotions of victim's families.\n\nOk then why not let the Aryan Nations build a church at the site where Martin Luther King was killed or erect a Shinto shrine for Emperor Hirohito at Pearl Harbor? This whole situation is nuts!\n\nOn top of the insenitivity being displayed by the Muslims in this situation, take at Inman Farouk Abdul Rauf who is in charge of the project . He has been linked to terrorist groups outside the US and he refuses to label Hamas as a terrorist organization. He has also blamed America as responsible in part for the 9/11 attack, as well as for the existence of Osama bin Ladin.\n\nThis guy is poking us in the eye and Obama is standing up for him. What a farce!\n\nHave we forgotten that dozens of innocent American Muslims perished on 9/11?\n\nHave we forgotten that many of our beloved forst-responders where of the Islamic faith?\n\nHow about the fact that 99% of ALL Muslim nations stood in solidarity with us against these attacks?\n\nIt appears we only have religious tolerance when it is our own religions is question...\n\nI'm sure Jesus would be proud?\n\nIt's at times like this when you can gauge the backbone of your reps. King took the easy way out and pandered to his consitutents base fear instead of upholding the constitution which he took an oath to do. Nuance? Really?\n\nAs a Christian, I am amazed that there is so much uproar and so much amnesia regarding this issue. Everyone wants the legacy of our forefathers to match their beliefs. If it were suggested that the 2nd amendment be modified to outlaw guns many would go crazy....but it's OK to change the 14th amendment to ban some from becoming citizens.\n\nNow many, mostly conservatives, want to forget the parts about \"Being Crated Equal\" and \"Freedom of Religion\". And Faux News it doing their usual best to propagate hate.\n\nRepublican Rep. Peter King says that since the attack on the WTC (I was there) was carried in the name of Islam, they are fair game...\n\nBy the same logic, since Hitler carried the murder of Jews in the name of Christianity....we should ban all Christian churches.\n\nAnd, by the same logic, no Christian churches should be allowed close to the Kansas City building where so many died....\n\nIt's about time that people realize that hating ALL Muslims does not make us any better that those Muslims who hate us....\n\nWake up America, we need to work together to get us out of the major problems we have, especially the economy. You (and most GOP politicians) can choose whether to want to be part of the problem or part of the solution....can't have it both ways.\n\nDiscrimination against a group of people, pure and simple.\n\nSociety has not evolved that much from the days of segregation.\n\n911 has opened many closets, and a lot of evil gets disguised as \"sensitivity\".\n\nAny resistance to the building of this Islamic Center, can only be based on ignorance and racism\n\nOur own George W. Bush and the administration, was well aware of, and part of those that carried out the attacks on the towers, killing over 3000 of our own people\n\nThey needed a good excuse to attack Iraq.\n\nTo the likes of Bush and Cheney, the lives of 3000 of our people are of less value than their own selfish agendas\n\nWake Up America, your greatest fears sleep in the beds, closest to your own\n\nThe Right Wingers again spewing their hate towards anyone who don't believe just like them. It's 3 blocks aways from the WTC site so who cares. Get real people and stop hating everyone who don't back your beliefs.\n\nObama and Nadler tie themselves in knots to justify their support for the islamists.\n\nMr. Nadler should understand one thing, and understand it well, when the Islamist begin butchering Jews en masse he should not expect any help from middle America. He and Obama have worked hard to empower the Islamist both in America and around the world. We will not come to Mr. Nadler defense since he is the one betraying himself and other Jews.\n\nKing said \"the attacks were carried out in the name of Islam.\" In the name of Christ abortion doctors have been murdered, the Inquistion has tortured and burnt at the stake countless innocents, and natvie people have had their cultures obliterated. Its wrong to judge Christianity on these acts, and its wrong to judge Islam on the acts of extremists.\n\nRELIGION AND TAXATION If the majority of republicans are opposed to Muslims building a mosque at ground zero in New York, Why are these people not against the IRS allowing charitable deductions to religion? Is this not making people who do not believe in religion pay more taxes because of deduction? Does this not run up the National Debt? Does this not violate the First Amendment of the Constitution, which states: Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion. If religion doesn't have to pay its fair share of taxes, what is it? I am not against deductions for religion, just hypocrisy! If republicans want to pay for unemployment benefits, they could stop deductions for religion. The National Debt is not necessary. We dont't need to borrow money from China when we have the Constitutional authority to create all the money needed: coin money and regulate the value thereof.

Kerry said recently, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nIt was a strange rhetorical choice. American officials have been referring to the Islamic State as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, since the group came out in April 2013.\n\nBut over the past month, Kerry and other Western officials have taken to using the Arabic acronym Daesh. Why? It\u2019s a reaction to reports that Islamic State fanboys fume when people use the Arabic acronym for the group instead of its fuller name. It\u2019s also an effort by Westerners to distinguish between Islam and the Islamic State. As French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius explained, \u201cI do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon made a similar argument using another version of the Islamic State\u2019s acronym. \u201cAs Muslim leaders around the world have said, groups like ISIL \u2013 or Daesh \u2014 have nothing to do with Islam, and they certainly do not represent a state,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should more fittingly be called the \u2018Un-Islamic Non-State.\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Obama said the same: \u201cISIL is not \u2018Islamic.\u2019 No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL\u2019s victims have been Muslim.\u201d\n\nNow, there\u2019s nothing wrong with verbally poking your enemy in the eye, especially when the enemy is awful and your words are accurate. But there are two problems with this strategy.\n\nThe first is what Harry Potter fans would recognize as the Voldemort Effect, wherein the books\u2019 protagonists fearfully refer to the villain Voldemort as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to avoid attracting his attention. Refusing to say the name of the Islamic State does something similar by enhancing the allure of the Group-That-Must-Not-Be-Named in radical quarters.\n\nRefusing to utter the Islamic State\u2019s name also needlessly complicates the religious fight to discredit the organization. Muslims understandably feel that their religion is being hijacked. But there\u2019s something odd about an American president or Secretary of State opining on what is and isn\u2019t legitimately Islamic. Shouldn\u2019t it go without saying that a murderous extremist group isn\u2019t what Muslims are all about?\n\nThere is a place for Muslim apologetics \u2014 from Muslims. This is precisely what a group of prominent British figures did when they attempted to rebrand the Islamic State as \u201cthe Un-Islamic State.\u201d\n\nBut when non-Muslim officials insert themselves into this debate, it sets a negative precedent. It lends itself easily to broader pronouncements on who the good, \u201cmoderate\u201d Muslims are, in contrast to the \u201cbad guys,\u201d a category which presumably could include anyone who falls on the Islamist side of the spectrum, regardless of whether they\u2019re actually \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\nAnd when the West co-opts Muslim talking points about the \u201ctrue\u201d Islam, it makes it harder for Muslims in the Arab world to make the same claim. Western governments are widely loathed and lack credibility in the region, even when they take care to explain their policies. A 2006 study suggested Arab students\u2019 views of American policy \u201cworsened slightly\u201d the longer they listened to U.S.-sponsored Radio Sawa and al-Hurra TV. When Western officials repeat religious criticisms of the Islamic State, they make it easier for the group\u2019s sympathizers to dismiss the criticisms as mere imperial dictation.\n\nLook, the impulse to join mainstream Muslims in their ideological fight against a common enemy comes from a good place. But non-Muslim officials would be better off not publicly involving themselves in the religious aspect of that fight or touting their attempts to do so in an effort to show solidarity with Muslims.\n\nAside from the ideological fight, there is also the matter of intellectual honesty. Insisting that the Islamic State has \u201cnothing to do with Islam\u201d is likely to strike Americans following the news as detached from reality. As former Bush administration official Elliot Abrams recently noted:\n\nThe people who are doing these things view themselves as good Muslims. That has to be addressed and explained. They\u2019re doing it because of their religion. So you cannot then say, \u2018No, no, you guys in ISIS, you guys in Al Qaeda, you don\u2019t understand Islam the way I do.\u2019 That\u2019s not a sensible thing to say.\n\nWhile religion isn\u2019t always the best way to understand the motivations of ISIS and its followers, it is, at the very least, relevant. We may not think the followers of the Islamic State are motivated by true Islam (whatever that might be). But it matters that they are motivated by what they think is true Islam.\n\nThe Islamic State has something to do with Islam.

Which makes it odd for you to be defending such a religion in strict\n\nterms. Becuase on faith alone Islam is indefensible and driect sponsor of violence, hatred, and venegence. Or perhaps you may share the view that\n\nreligion is separate from culture, in which case you would be justified to desire to stick up for Isalmic religion. However, you must than conceede to\n\nthe notion that culture and regilion are a mutually exclusive non-interdependent system of beliefs. And this \"could\" be true only under a strict analysis\n\nof specific and controled circumstances. Enviromental influences are always factors and can not be discounted in the real world. As well,\n\nenvirnomental factors of cultural are not a function of religion or religous doctrine, but the religous doctrine can be distorted by the culture. This is\n\nIslam's great issue and the one that puts it at odds with the West, be it right or wrong. The desert hostile enviroment has given birth to many more\n\npeople than it can comfortable support and this creates a cultural of violence and hostile envy that is separate from religion and specific to\n\nenvironmental factors. This cultural feeling is then interperated by the relgious machine and a new system of thinking is spawned. Islam and Arab\n\ndesert cultural has saddly spawned of vicious culutre of revenage and deadly envy. When was the last time a black American blow up a group of\n\nwhites as a payback for salvery? The enviroment does not support this thought pattern therefor it has not happened.\n\nThe logical deduction is that the term \"Musilm\" represents of those of a particular religious faith and not necessarily their cultural beliefs is both true\n\nand false. It is this matter of cultural beliefs which are at the crux of the issue that divides the West and the Middle East in terms of identity and\n\nIslam and the religion on paper is not where the problem lies, the culture and its contextual subtext is where the issue lies as it always does in human\n\npyschology. The human pschye is where the problem reside and that cannot be found on paper. This interpreation is an amalgamation of truth and\n\nbelifs based on infrences and real world experiences.

This is not a phenomen cause by Islam or being Musilm rather, I postulate that this\n\nway of life and thinking is derived from the nature of living in the harsh environment of the desert. There few resources in the desert which makes\n\npeople like their surroundings, consistently harsh and unchanging. While coming the defense of Islam as a religion is acceptable discounting the real cultural basis for the thought process of desert arab peopples is not. Their specific lack of environmental resources has yeilded them their thought process and cultural belif system that is mutally exclusive of religion as it appears on paper.\n\nPosted November 29, 2006 3:43 PM"], "summary": ["A conversation on religion with Jon Meacham, Sally Quinn and Sherman Jackson.  Visit http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/sherman_jackson/"]}, {"title": ["Public schools shouldn\u2019t preach. But they should teach kids about religion."], "text": ["The day Jesus entered my fourth-grade classroom, my childhood forever changed.\n\nIt was 1974, and my family had just moved from western New York state to rural Ohio. I was the new kid, and all I wanted was to fit in. But one afternoon that first week, a woman hired by local churches walked into my public-school classroom and my regular teacher left. She stuck figures of Jesus Christ and his disciples on a flannel board, told us how Jesus could solve people\u2019s problems and, a little while later, asked us all to sing the hymn, \u201cJesus Loves Me.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m Jewish.\n\nI didn\u2019t know the song and I didn\u2019t believe in Jesus. I told my parents and they complained to the school, but the agreed-upon resolution was excusing me from this weekly religious instruction. My brothers and I were the only Jewish kids in the school system, and every week when it came time for religion class, my 11-year-old brother and I were, effectively, banished by our classroom teachers.\n\nThat was roughly 40 years ago, and if this sort of proselytizing were the norm today, I\u2019d certainly understand why many parents remain skittish about outsourcing the teaching of basics about different religions to the public schools. But if anything, when disputes arise over teaching about religion as part of public school curriculum, educators wind up getting the message that they might be better off playing it safe and shying away from the subject, even at a moment when it\u2019s critical that children are equipped with an understanding of various religions and the role they play in today\u2019s world \u2014 particularly the religion that\u2019s so often misunderstood: Islam.\n\nTake the example of Wellesley Middle School in suburban Boston. In the fall of 2010, a parent chaperone, concerned about a sixth-grade field trip to a local mosque, videotaped a handful of students who appeared to kneel and pray in a line of male worshippers. The kids were only copying what they saw, but critics said the kids were effectively learning to \u201cpray to Allah.\u201d\n\nThe idea of children praying in a mosque on a school-sponsored trip raised fears that the program was forcing religion on unsuspecting children. And the school system rightly acknowledged that the boys shouldn\u2019t have wound up participating in the prayer \u2014 they should have only observed. But for more than a decade, Wellesley has been getting it right when it comes to teaching about religion, and the school\u2019s detractors have come primarily from outside of the district. Most Wellesley parents I interviewed around the time of the incident appreciated that their 11- and 12-year-olds spent a semester learning about Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism.\n\nEvery year at Minneha Core Knowledge Magnet Elementary School in Wichita, Kansas, first graders learn about Judaism, Christianity and Islam over the course of several weeks \u2014 a curriculum the school has stood by, in spite of a misunderstanding two years ago about a bulletin board that illustrated the Five Pillars of Islam.\n\nOn occasion, yes, schools get into public messes over where the line is drawn between church and state \u2014 like recent reports of a \u201cmass baptism\u201d taking place on campus prior to a Georgia high school\u2019s football practice.\n\nBut in my travels around the country reporting for my book, \u201cFaith Ed.: Teaching About Religion in An Age of Intolerance,\u201d I didn\u2019t see teachers trying to preach Christianity \u2014 or any \u2014 faith. I saw educators trying to provide kids with facts about the histories and practices of world religions, including faiths about which few students knew anything.\n\nAnd the takeaway isn\u2019t that there\u2019s a danger our schools will veer toward religious indoctrination. It\u2019s that schools should do more to give religion a firm place in the curriculum, beginning as early as the elementary grades. That way, kids will be prepared, as they grow, to evaluate what they see every night on cable TV based on real information, rather than a set of stereotypes.\n\nThey should know the difference between Shi\u2019a and Sunni Islam \u2014 not as a perfunctory nod to diversity, but because they\u2019ll be able to better form opinions about the Middle East conflicts that dominate the news. They should know the difference between Sikhism and Hinduism, considering that those are the respective religions of the last two prime ministers of India \u2014 the world\u2019s largest democracy. They should have a historical perspective on the differences between Catholicism and Protestant denominations when the pope visits their country, as he\u2019s doing this month. It\u2019s problematic, as Texas State University\u2019s Joseph Laycock notes, to wait for college to teach religion as a subject, because \u201cmany Americans never have the opportunity to go to college.\u201d\n\nThere are parents and educators who consider first grade too early to teach about religion in school, but as the parent of a 7-year-old, I believe it\u2019s the ideal time to start increasing children\u2019s awareness about our pluralistic society. Consider that in a Pew survey a few years ago, just 45 percent of Americans could identify Friday as the start of the Jewish Sabbath. That\u2019s the sort of rudimentary knowledge that can, and should, be explained in elementary school.\n\nNo, we can\u2019t expect kids to grasp all the nuances of the major world religions and the controversies surrounding them, but if we\u2019re preparing kids to be thoughtful citizens of the world, they should know something about people in their community who may be different from themselves. My son has been attending religious school since kindergarten. He knows the major figures in Judaism as well as the holidays. But ask him what Easter is about \u2014 other than bunnies and colorful eggs \u2014 and he really has no idea. I\u2019m happy that he knows his own religious heritage, but I also want him to know more about his peers\u2019 different traditions.\n\nIn my conversations with students about world religion courses, young people told me about their experiences being bullied because of their faiths. A 24-year-old Sikh man recalled the humiliation he felt at age 5 when fellow kindergartners made fun of his patka, his traditional religious head covering. A Muslim sixth-grader remembered a classmate\u2019s taunt from a few years before: \u201cDo you have a bomb in your locker?\u201d Muslims talk about being stigmatized every time a news story breaks about a terrorist who has a connection to Islam.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no consensus about developing best practices for teaching about religion in public schools. At best, America\u2019s schools, which have long had a tumultuous relationship with religion, largely because of prayer-in-school battles, are in flux. The country has only one school system, Modesto, Calif., that requires a world religions course for graduation. Minneha, in Wichita, goes in a different direction, among roughly 1,200 private and public schools that utilize Core Knowledge, a well-known, but not widely adopted curriculum.\n\nThe First Amendment proscribes \u201cestablishment\u201d of religion, but clearly leaves room for schools to teach about religion. And while 70 percent of Americans still identify as Christian and we still debate whether we\u2019re \u201ca Christian nation,\u201d those who argue for the installation of religious values in public schools are on Constitutionally shaky ground \u2014 as are those who say instruction that explains religion has to be banned.\n\nEducators and religion scholars of today generally agree that Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark did the most to elevate religion\u2019s place as an academic subject in the 1963 Abington v. Schempp case, banning teacher-led prayer, in which he wrote: \u201cIt might well be said that one\u2019s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization.\u201d Yet many middle and high school teachers spend only a few days discussing religion as the topic comes up in social studies. It\u2019s unusual to do much of anything at the elementary level.\n\nDespite efforts over the last several decades, moves to develop courses and training for teaching religion have begun and often fizzled, even though most states now have standards that call for a religion component in social studies and geography.\n\nWe need to resurrect those efforts, because the time to become a more religiously literate people is overdue.\n\nAfter 9/11, wrote John Seigenthaler, founder of the First Amendment Center, \u201cIt is no longer a question of whether schools should teach children about Islam. They must teach them \u2014 about other religions as well. It is a responsibility, a duty.\u201d Nationally, we need to renew dialogue about the best way to teach about religion, how to better train teachers and how early the lessons should begin. We need an understanding that it\u2019s not only okay to teach about religion in schools, but vital. Too often, knee-jerk reactions to lessons on religion come from adults who harbor misconceptions they otherwise might not have if they, themselves, had a broader base of knowledge about different religions.\n\nEducation can\u2019t eliminate ignorance, but it can reduce it. The same Muslim boy who was teased in elementary school described how peers stood up for him in a later incident and chided a substitute teacher for claiming that all Muslims were terrorists. The students had remembered the lesson from sixth grade that it was wrong to stereotype based on religion.\n\nEducation is essential if we hope to facilitate a broader conversation. We can\u2019t effectively debate whether Islam is a religion of peace \u2014 as its defenders say \u2014 or if it is inherently bellicose \u2014 as its critics suggest \u2014 until we first have a body politic that knows the basics.\n\nEducation might have prevented what happened to me as a kid. I returned to my alma mater in 2013 to find my school system teaching about religion as part of social studies and teens respectful of other faiths even though few personally knew a non-Christian. The difference? In the \u201970s and \u201980s, my peers and I lacked what all schools should have today: teachers who can guide students through a healthier discussion about religious differences and similarities."], "summary": ["If we want kids to understand their world, they need to know the basics about different faith traditions."]}, {"title": ["Is religious violence real?

Christopher Stevens, nor the three others staffers at the US consulate in Libya, had been murdered by religion-inspired terrorists. Nor had the world known as much about the hateful film which roused the murderers' rage. Tragically, yesterday's important question is today's pressing news.\n\nReligious violence is real, and so is hatred of both religion in general and of specific religious traditions. In fact, proponents of each, make use of the other to justify their own ugliest words and deeds -- including murder.\n\nWhat do you say about religious violence, what causes it and how to address it. These are questions which we simply cannot avoid.\n\nThe answer to me is unfortunately yes. Unfortunately because we demonize entire groups for the actions of a few. Unfortunately because we attack religions as a whole because we don't understand them. Unfortunately because we attack others because we feel they are insulting our religions. Unfortunately because we neither turn the other cheek nor focus our anger properly. Unfortunately because we don't temper the strength of our convictions with the necessary strength to accept others may not agree with us and we cannot change them. Religous violence and the fear thereof unfortunately is real- look no further than the synagogues and mosques with police cars parked out front- but is unfortunately nothing more than a human failing.\n\nLet's assume you are correct that the abuses you describe are endemic to the human condition, even though I think you may be confusing historical record with biological, psychological or spiritual necessity. Even if it is essentially human to do all the things you describe, do we need to accept it, or should we not be working to curtail, if not erradicate, such behavior? In other words, 'Don't Give Up!\"\n\nReligious violence is real -- and more accutely so over the last 24 hours than some might have been willing to admit. That said however, there are things we can do to work against it, but doing so means taking both religion, and it's flaws, very seriously.\n\nNo more battels between haters of faith (or any faith in particular) vs. apologists for faith (or any one faith in particular). That approach gets people dead.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 12:59 PM\n\nOf course religious violence is real. It has happened throughout human history with all religions, but it is telling that most religious violence/terrorism these past few decades have been in the name of Islam.\n\nSadly, you are right on both counts. Of course, that means that the problem is not a function of one tradition even if it currently manifests more in one tradtion. Unfortunately, when you point out your first point, the Islam-bashers call you a fool. When you point out your second point, you are often called an Islamophobe. Having been called both, I know.\n\nThe challenge lies in creating a culture of honest critique -- one which protects a faith and it's followers, the vast majority of whom do NOT have a problem, while challenging them to take the lead from within, in addressing the problem which does exist.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:03 PM\n\nThe real problem isn't religion but absolutism and authoritarianism. That describes some religions and some believers, but far from all of them, and it also describes some secular ideologies and some of their adherents.\n\nAemn! Faith is like a fire -- it can warm your home and cook your dinner, or it can burn down the house and kill a bunch of people in the process. The issue is not faith per se, or any one faith in particular, it is how the faithful weild their faith. The absolutists burn everything down, themselves included, when given enough time.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:05 PM\n\nWith the deadly attacks in Libya yesterday, I'd say yes, religious violence is real.\n\nAnd while we settled on this topic before the murders, it makes this conversation that much more critical to have. Sadly, too many responses from the Middle East refuse to accept that. President Morsi in Egypt exhonterated the United States from \"guilt\" for the hateful film which inspired the attacks, but stilled called for the makers to be punsihed for their \"outrage\". So much for appreciating freedom of expression. And worse still, Sheihk Hassan Nassrallah, leader of Hezbollah, decried the film but not the murders!\n\nThe film, at least the parts I have seen, is grotesque and people should say so. But the rersponses of these and other religious leaders is pretty disturbing, to say the least.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:10 PM\n\nOh, it's real alright. Start with the Crusades or start with 9/11, but killing in the name of god is a long-time practice. The next question is the one I would like religious leaders to address more directly: what is your church - temple-mosque, and what is your entire institution, doing about it? For all the good that religion provides in people's lives, regardless of the faith, the fact that so many faiths inspire violence makes me question . . . that sometimes the costs outweigh the benefits.\n\nThe costs outweighting the benefits, often is a matter of whom you ask. The fact is, that in many cases, the worst offenders in terms of relgious violence and oppression of others, are often people who use religion as forces for incredible good within their own community.\n\nI think your initial point is the important one. We need to ask every relgious institution and culture what it does to mitigate violence and oppression of those who do not share their views. The treatment of those outseide one's camp is real test of the ethical health of any spiritual community.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:14 PM\n\nEarlier this year, Saudi Arabia executed a woman for witchcraft. In Iran, the minimum marriage age for girls is nine. These are not nations of illiterates who live in mud huts, they're among the most prosperous non-western countries on earth. How can literate people believe such things are right? It's only possible because they accept that a 7th century text was written by the most supreme intelligence in the universe, and enforces the death penalty on those who say otherwise. At what point can we stop respecting the beliefs of those who don't respect the right to dispute them?\n\nIf your point is that elements of Islam are deeply problematic, we agree. But I would say that their are serious problems with other ancient tradtions when they are used as direct arbiters of contemporary nations and the laws which guide them. In other words, theocracy is bad. About that, we agree.\n\nThe respect issue is complicated if you are asking must a genuine pluralist extend greater understanding to non-pluralists than they give us. The answer is yes and no. Sorry to be so talmudic, but that's the way it is.\n\nWe offer respect, even to those who may not respect us, for our own sakes as much as for theirs. We show thenm respect because it refelcts our values to do so. The limit on respect for others is not a function of reciprocity, but vulnerability. In other words, when they move from disrespect to coercion, then we move from respect to working against them.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:20 PM\n\nIt seems to me that almost any aggrieved group, religious, tribal, national... Will generate some amount of fanaticism. How widespread it becomes is probably affected by the role of authority both official and unofficial in either opposing or supporting it. In recent history some level of official and unofficial leadership within Islam has given either tacit or clear approval for terrorism. Religion and maybe more specifically in the monotheistic faiths might be more effective incubators of fanaticism than other social groups because religion is so important in many people's lives. Monotheistic faiths might be more prone to fanatical terrorism because they can more easily create and sustain a manichean view of life; that my/our view of God is right and that yours is wrong and should be attacked or suppressed\n\nYour point that it is fanaticism which kills, is correct. It's why, in additon to describing my own spiritual and politcal journey, the sub title of my most recent book is \"finding faith without fanaticism\".\n\nThat Monotheistic tradtions are inherently more dangerous than other tradtions is likely not correct, as a full read of history demonstrates. Not only that, but the non-God-centered ideologies of the 20th century -- think marxism, naziism, maoism -- killed more people than all those killed in the name of faith in the previous 1 0r 2 thousand years! Something to think about.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:24 PM\n\nI'm far from an expert on this topic, but as a politically liberal Christian American (if it makes any difference, which I'm not sure it does), it does seem to me that Muslims are very quick to take offense, and violent offense at that, to any perceived slight to their religion. I think a telling comparison is one of the protesters asked a CNN reporter, \"How would Americans feel if a film were made attacking Christianity? Or attacking Abraham Lincoln?\" I can honestly say I would feel absolutely zero compulsion to protest or attack anything if I came across such a film. I would probably make a mental note that I disagree, and then move on. I wouldn't give it another thought for the rest of the day. (Also, perhaps this person didn't realize that there have been quite a few recent, popular films denigrating U.S. presidents...) So the problem here seems to be more cultural than religious. I think in the West, we're used to people saying all sorts of crazy and offensive and untrue things about ideas we hold dear, and we value the right of the freedom to say those things more than the \"right not to be offended.\" This cultural value seems to be absent in cultures that are also influenced by Islam. I realize I'm veering dangerously close to Huntington's \"Clash of Civilizations\" argument that my fellow liberals love to hate, but the fact is that there is *something* about the culture there that us Westerners just fundamentally don't understand. But this stems from cultural differences, not religious ones. To be sure, religion is a large part of a culture, but there's nothing inherent to Islam that compels its adherents to go on killing sprees when they hear something they don't like. There are larger cultural forces at play here, I think.\n\nIf the term \"larger religious forces\" is used to get either Islam or Muslims fully off the hook, then I reject the use of the term and find it quite dangerous. If the term is meant to reflect that all relgious systems are also cultural systems and, as you wrote, \"there's nothing inherent to Islam that compels its adherents to go on killing sprees when they hear something they don't like\", we agree agree 100%\n\nIslam is a rich and wonderful traditon -- one equipped with more than enough spiritual and intellectual tools to fight against certain current trends within the culture. The issue is not the faith per se, but it is a faith issue when people make it more religious to fight against the insult than to educate against it.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:30 PM\n\nYes, religious violence exists, but I have always felt that religion was not just about which god you believed in. Religion, or at least organized religion is intrinsically tied to a people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture, which is tied to a people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s politics or economics. When violent occurrences happen, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about religion, or not just about economics or just about politics or just about culture. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combination of all those things mixed together. Why else is the U.S\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with Islam so different in Malaysia than it is in the Middle East?\n\nHumans exists within larger contexts. We call those contexts, cultures. The only problem is when the followers of any faith refuse to take any measure of responsibility for the role their faith has in toxifying the culture. The same people who want to go on about the positive contributions of whatever faith they follow must be the same ones who shoulder the burden of it's misdeeds. Without that, they are dangerous apologists providing cover to the worst elements of their faith community, even of they don't approve of them. and to be crystal clear, that problem can be found among all believers -- whatever tradition they may follow.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:35 PM\n\nProblem is Islam still functions as if we were still in the 13th century in many parts of the world. Now Roman Catholicism still believes its right before the Reformation but at least it doesnt resort to violence except in Ireland which is justified. Problem is most of the Muslim world is a lack of democracy caused by Islam and no jobs also caused by Islam, A move to early 20th century by Islam might help. BTW if I am going to paradise the heck with 20 virgins I want 20 porn stars. Never understood Islam's fetish for virgins.\n\nGo slow. For starters, Islam is a deeply democratic tradition. It has little centralized authority, and it is Islamists who have been at the forefront over the last decades, in leading democratic movements. the problem is that democracy is not the same as the kind of liberal (small \"l\"), rights-driven, individual-respecting systems which we equate with democracy. People can, and do, select oppressive regimes through democratic processes. The often go so far as to reaffirm them because they have no concern about what \"toqueville called, \"tyranny of the majority\".\n\nFinally, the role of reformation is a crucial one. Interesting, Judaism had one at about the 1500 year mark in its history, and so did Christianity at the 1,500 year oint in its evolution. that is exactly where we are today relative to the start of Islam. That is, by no means, an excuse but it might be a helpful explanation and lense through whcih to view contemporary challenges.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:42 PM\n\nThe violence is real whether it is called religious violence or domestic violence both are related because of the violence. Giving it a noun modifer may soften the real word which is violence. I do this in the name of religion because it excuses my violent behavior. What religion condones violence? None. Power hungry, controlling, fearful, hate-filled, and violent people always have an excuse for their behavior and hide behind supposedly religious values and religion. Actually, they have no values and have no religion. They only have violence. And really, their true religion is hate.\n\nI wish it were so, but you are just wrong. In fact, virtually every major faith condones violence -- certainl y the case for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Each has texts which justify violence, and each has used them to terrible effect at different points in their respective histories, not to mention right now.\n\nAll these thigs are to be found in each of tradtions because they are in each of us. Most importantly, we can only address the problem of relgious violence on terms that are meaningful to these who practice it, so whether we like it or not, that means taking the claim that the violence is genuinely religious, at least for those practiciing it, is necessary.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:46 PM\n\nAs a Christian, I would hope that Muslims not define me with Koran burner Terry Jones. So why do so many Christians define all Muslims by their fanatical elements?\n\nEach side is filled with those who love to compare their best to the \"other\" side's worst. They do so because when that is the comparison one makes, their own tradition always \"wins\". The real challenge, teh challenge to haivng a mature faith is being able to love your own tradition while seeing it's worst and appreating the best of those traditions you don't choose.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:48 PM\n\nMitt Romney is condemning the Obama administration over the press release from the Cairo embassy. Is the press release truly an apology? What constitutes an apology anyway?\n\nHaving read the President's remarks, I don't think they constitute an apology by any means. That said, I think Gov. Romney was responding to the President's decision to focus on the film which inspired the murderers before the bodies of teh murdered were even cold. Context counts, but so does timing. the Adminsitration seemed to appreciate the first, but not the second.\n\nThe fact that Sec. State Clinton called the attacks \"surprising\" was more concerning to me. Sadly, there really isn't anything surprising about violent mobs arising in the face of what is percieved of as disrespectful media, let alone genuinely anti-Muslim media such as the film. It's tragic, but not surprising.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:54 PM\n\nI don't know why these filmmakers keep on making films depicting Mohammed in such a bad light, knowing that they insite violence. It's like yelling \"fire,\" in a crowded theatre. These fundamental Islamists do not know how to react other than by violence; we know it; so just stop it...even if it does impinge on some rights. The killing of our Ambassador and his staff is horrendous and the fundamentalists are stupid enough to want to spread violence. Let's not give them the ammunition.\n\nYour argument sound dangerously like appeasement to me, and that is a VERY dangerous road to go. To be clear, the reason not to make films like the one which got the crowds going is NOT because it will upset them, but because the film is hateful, stupid and ugly.\n\nDecent people, especially those who appreciate the real challenges in significant segmants of the global Muslim community should be at the forefront of decrying the film and it's message. We should protest the film and any of it's ilk not because they anger some Muslims, but because they pollute our public culture and degrade decent human beings.\n\n\u2013 September 12, 2012 1:58 PM\n\nWe could go on for a long time -- especially based on the quality of the comments and questions that remain in line, but our time is at hand.\n\nWe can continue this conversation if you find me on facebook or follow me on twitter @bradhirschfield.\n\n'Til next week, and I say this as a prayer as much as anything else, this week especially,"], "summary": ["Brad Hirschfield is discussing religious violence."]}, {"title": ["Muhammad Ali pulls no punches in schooling Donald Trump over the true meaning of Islam"], "text": ["Donald Trump accepts his Muhammad Ali award from Ali at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night XIII in March 2007.

In Mr. Maher\u2019s view, Islam has \u201ctoo much in common with ISIS.\u201d\n\nHis comments have led to a flurry of responses, perhaps none so passionate as that of the actor Ben Affleck, who lambasted Mr. Maher, on Mr. Maher\u2019s own HBO show, for \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d generalizations about Muslims.\n\nYet there is a real lack of sophistication on both sides of the argument when it comes to discussing religion and violence.\n\nOn one hand, people of faith are far too eager to distance themselves from extremists in their community, often denying that religious violence has any religious motivation whatsoever. This is especially true of Muslims, who often glibly dismiss those who commit acts of terror in the name of Islam as \u201cnot really Muslim.\u201d\n\nOn the other, critics of religion tend to exhibit an inability to understand religion outside of its absolutist connotations. They scour holy texts for bits of savagery and point to extreme examples of religious bigotry, of which there are too many, to generalize about the causes of oppression throughout the world.\n\nWhat both the believers and the critics often miss is that religion is often far more a matter of identity than it is a matter of beliefs and practices. The phrase \u201cI am a Muslim,\u201d \u201cI am a Christian,\u201d \u201cI am a Jew\u201d and the like is, often, not so much a description of what a person believes or what rituals he or she follows, as a simple statement of identity, of how the speaker views her or his place in the world.\n\nAs a form of identity, religion is inextricable from all the other factors that make up a person\u2019s self-understanding, like culture, ethnicity, nationality, gender and sexual orientation. What a member of a suburban megachurch in Texas calls Christianity may be radically different from what an impoverished coffee picker in the hills of Guatemala calls Christianity. The cultural practices of a Saudi Muslim, when it comes to the role of women in society, are largely irrelevant to a Muslim in a more secular society like Turkey or Indonesia. The differences between Tibetan Buddhists living in exile in India and militant Buddhist monks persecuting the Muslim minority known as the Rohingya, in neighboring Myanmar, has everything to do with the political cultures of those countries and almost nothing to do with Buddhism itself.\n\nNo religion exists in a vacuum. On the contrary, every faith is rooted in the soil in which it is planted. It is a fallacy to believe that people of faith derive their values primarily from their Scriptures. The opposite is true. People of faith insert their values into their Scriptures, reading them through the lens of their own cultural, ethnic, nationalistic and even political perspectives.\n\nAfter all, scripture is meaningless without interpretation. Scripture requires a person to confront and interpret it in order for it to have any meaning. And the very act of interpreting a scripture necessarily involves bringing to it one\u2019s own perspectives and prejudices.\n\nThe abiding nature of scripture rests not so much in its truth claims as it does in its malleability, its ability to be molded and shaped into whatever form a worshiper requires. The same Bible that commands Jews to \u201clove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (Leviticus 19:18) also exhorts them to \u201ckill every man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey,\u201d who worship any other God (1 Sam. 15:3). The same Jesus Christ who told his disciples to \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d (Matthew 5:39) also told them that he had \u201cnot come to bring peace but the sword\u201d (Matthew 10:34), and that \u201che who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one\u201d (Luke 22:36). The same Quran that warns believers \u201cif you kill one person it is as though you have killed all of humanity\u201d (5:32) also commands them to \u201cslay the idolaters wherever you find them\u201d (9:5).\n\nHow a worshiper treats these conflicting commandments depends on the believer. If you are a violent misogynist, you will find plenty in your scriptures to justify your beliefs. If you are a peaceful, democratic feminist, you will also find justification in the scriptures for your point of view.\n\nWhat does this mean, in practical terms? First, simplistic knee-jerk response among people of faith to dismiss radicals in their midst as \u201cnot us\u201d must end. Members of the Islamic State are Muslims for the simple fact that they declare themselves to be so. Dismissing their profession of belief prevents us from dealing honestly with the inherent problems of reconciling religious doctrine with the realities of the modern world. But considering that most of its victims are also Muslims \u2014 as are most of the forces fighting and condemning the Islamic State \u2014 the group\u2019s self-ascribed Islamic identity cannot be used to make any logical statement about Islam as a global religion.\n\nAt the same time, critics of religion must refrain from simplistic generalizations about people of faith. It is true that in many Muslim countries, women do not have the same rights as men. But that fact alone is not enough to declare Islam a religion that is intrinsically more patriarchal than Christianity or Judaism. (It\u2019s worth noting that Muslim-majority nations have elected women leaders on several occasions, while some Americans still debate whether the United States is ready for a female president.)\n\nBill Maher is right to condemn religious practices that violate fundamental human rights. Religious communities must do more to counter extremist interpretations of their faith. But failing to recognize that religion is embedded in culture \u2014 and making a blanket judgment about the world\u2019s second largest religion \u2014 is simply bigotry.\n\nReza Aslan, a professor of creative writing at the University of California, Riverside, is the author, most recently, of \u201cZealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth.\u201d"], "summary": ["In Islam and other faiths, religion is more often a matter of culture and identity than beliefs and practices."]}]
