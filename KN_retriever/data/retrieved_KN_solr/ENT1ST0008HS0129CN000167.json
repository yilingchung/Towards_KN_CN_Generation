[{"title": ["Targeting of London Muslims triples after Paris attacks"], "text": ["Attacks against Muslims in London have more than tripled since the Paris terrorist atrocity, with the majority involving harassment, figures show.\n\nThe Metropolitan police said they had received 24 reports of Islamophobic incidents in the week ending 10 November, three days before the massacre in the French capital. That figure rose to 46 in the week ending 17 November, four days after the attacks. There was a further rise of reported attacks in the week ending 24 November, when the tally reached 76.\n\nA police spokesman said: \u201cIt is with regret, but something that we have come to realise, through experience, that hate crime can increase during these difficult times.\n\n\u201cWe know Muslim communities in London are feeling anxious and we are providing extra patrols and are speaking regularly with local mosques and community leaders to reassure and address concerns, while closely monitoring the situation.\n\n\u201cWe will not tolerate hate crime,\u201d he said, adding that there were 900 specialist officers working across London in community safety units dedicated to investigating hate crime. \u201cNo one should suffer in silence. We urge people to report hate crime to us as soon as possible so we can act.\u201d\n\nThe findings follow a series of high-profile anti-Muslim attacks carried out on public transport. Footage emerged last month of a woman wearing a hijab being pushed into an oncoming train on the London Underground. The attacker has since been charged with attempted murder.\n\nMiqdaad Versi, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cThe UK as a whole is renowned for its respect for everyone, but there is a genuine concern that Islamophobia is on the rise.\u201d\n\nHe said Friday\u2019s Scotland Yard figures were\u201ccorroborated by report after report, from a range of different third parties. Even a mosque in our cosmopolitan capital, Finsbury Park mosque, only luckily escaped an arson attack that the Met Police called a hate crime.\u201d\n\nVersi was referring to the incident in which CCTV images showed a man trying to set the mosque on fire by throwinga molotov cocktail which failed to explode.\n\nCan you help @MPSIslington identify this man over an attempted arson at #FinsburyPark Mosque https://t.co/fwOJZJcfg5 pic.twitter.com/BrQj5OJ5dR\n\nVersi, who speaks for the MCB on terrorism and security issues, said there had been a rise in both verbal and phyical attacks. \u201cWe really need to take this this form of bigotry seriously and all forms of bigotry need to be treated equally by the government in order for us to be able to tackle this.\u201d\n\nDavid Cameron has promised more will be done to tackle Islamophobic crime, announcing in autumn that such crimes are to be recorded as a separate category for the first time.\n\nVersi said the figures may not take into account all the attacks Muslims have faced in the last few weeks. \u201cUnfortunately, from our own experience many people have suffered and have chosen not to report them. In spite of these figures being bad, it is likely that many have not been reported.\u201d\n\nAn anti-racism rally has been planned on Friday evening outside Finsbury Park mosque, a week after the attempted arson attack. A vigil is to be held to show unity against all forms of racism. \u201cSociety as a whole will continue to work together and show that we will not be divided by people who want to divide us,\u201d Versi said.\n\nThe hate crime figures were released a day after the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, announced he was launching the UK branch of the rightwing group Pegida. He said he would campaign to ban all Muslim immigration to the UK for five years, prevent the building of new mosques and ban the funding of mosques abroad.\n\nHate crime figures released earlier this year showed the number of incidences reported to police across England and Wales had jumped by nearly a fifth. There were 52,528 such offences in 2014/15 \u2013 an increase of 18% compared with the previous year. More than 80% were classed as race hate crimes, with others involved religion, disability, sexual orientation and transgender victims.\n\nAnalysis of the Crime survey for England and Wales indicated that Muslims were more likely than people from other faith groups to be targeted in religiously motivated crimes.\n\nContrary to reports, statisticians found there was no clear spike in offences around the time of the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham in August last year, or the Charlie Hebdo terrorist shooting in Paris in January.\n\nPolice figures also pointed to rising levels of antisemitic hate crimes in parts of the UK. In London, the number of offences against Jewish people and property more than doubled in a year."], "summary": ["Police figures show rise in Islamophobic incidents to 76 a week, amid crimes including attempted murder and arson"]}, {"title": ["Britain\u2019s Dangerous New Tribalism"], "text": ["LONDON \u2014 This past week marked the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 attacks in London. On July 7, 2005, 52 people were killed when four suicide bombers detonated explosive devices on subways and buses. There were commemorations across the nation to honor the victims, including a ceremony of remembrance at the 7/7 memorial in Hyde Park and a service at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\n\nThe 10 years that have elapsed have perhaps softened the original shock, which was not just at the death toll but at the realization that the bombers were not foreigners but British citizens steeped in this country\u2019s life and culture. In the decade since, the homegrown jihadi has become almost a fixture in British life.\n\nThere has been no repeat of the bombings, but the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has transformed the character of domestic jihadism. Some 700 British Muslims are believed to have joined the Islamic State \u2014 not just young men like those who carried out the 7/7 attacks, but mothers, grandfathers, schoolgirls and doctors.\n\nThree days before the anniversary, 12 members of the Mannan family from Luton, a town about 30 miles north of London, put out a statement explaining why they had traveled to Islamic State territory in Syria. The family, of Bangladeshi origin, claimed to be happy to be living in \u201ca land that is free from the corruption and oppression of man-made law and is governed by the Shariah,\u201d referring to Islamic law.\n\nThis exodus to Syria has led non-Muslims to point an accusing finger at Muslim communities. Last month, the prime minister, David Cameron, condemned those who, though not violent, \u201cbuy into\u201d the prejudices of Islamism and \u201cquietly condone\u201d the actions of the Islamic State. A poll published last week found that 56 percent of Britons thought that Islam posed a threat to Western liberal democracy, a figure 10 points higher than a decade ago.\n\nSurveys of Muslim opinion may seem to confirm such perceptions. A poll earlier this year showed that more than a quarter of British Muslims had some sympathy for the motives behind the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed by two gun-wielding Islamists. More than one in 10 thought the magazine deserved to be attacked for lampooning the Prophet Muhammad. A 2006 poll found that 40 percent of Muslims would welcome Shariah law in Britain.\n\nAt the same time, Muslim activists say that anti-Muslim attacks have skyrocketed in recent years. Figures from the Metropolitan Police in 2014 indicated that hate crimes against Muslims had risen by 65 percent in the previous 12 months. Mehdi Hasan, a prominent Muslim commentator, wrote recently of the \u201crelentless hostility towards Muslims.\u201d\n\nAll this might suggest a nation polarized between alienated Muslims and non-Muslims hostile to Islam. The reality is otherwise. What is striking about the past decade is not conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims, but the relative ease with which different communities have got along.\n\nMany polls have shown that Muslims identify with Britain to a greater degree than the population at large. In a 2009 survey, 77 percent said that they strongly identified with Britain, compared with 51 percent of the general population. Similarly, a poll in 2011 found that 83 percent of Muslims were proud to be British, compared with 79 percent of Britons in general.\n\nWhile anti-Muslim hatred is certainly present, there is by no means a climate of \u201crelentless hostility\u201d toward Muslims. According to a poll from the Pew Research Center, 19 percent of Britons had an unfavorable view of Muslims, while 72 percent looked upon Muslims favorably. Nearly twice as many of those surveyed had an unfavorable view of Roma people.\n\nA generation ago, hate crimes like assaults, murders and firebombings were common. Today, vicious racist violence is, thankfully, rare. Much of the rise in hate crimes has involved verbal and online abuse. That is still unacceptable, but we should not exaggerate the hostility.\n\nSo, if in practice Muslims and non-Muslims coexist relatively peaceably, how do we explain the polarization in attitudes? Why do so many non-Muslim Britons regard Islam as a threat, while so many Muslims yearn for Shariah law?\n\nIn part, the seeming contradictions expose the difficulty of reading opinion polls; people\u2019s answers often change significantly, depending on the wording and context of questions. But they also throw light on the character of British society today.\n\nPoliticians constantly call for a defense of British values against extremism. But beyond platitudes about liberal democracy, they find it hard to articulate what those values are. At the same time, these leaders constantly undermine fundamental liberal values in the name of fighting terrorism: They have increased state surveillance, restricted free speech and banned certain organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing disaffection with mainstream politics among Muslims and non-Muslims alike has found expression in a politics of identity, which encourages people to understand their problems through the narrow lenses of culture and faith. The overall result is that people see values less as ideals than in terms of identity. For many non-Muslims, for example, the idea of Shariah conjures images of Islamic State beheadings or the oppression of women. For many Muslims, supporting Shariah may mean no more than an affirmation of identity.\n\nThe real problem is neither Muslim disloyalty nor rampant Islamophobia. It is, rather, the emergence of a tribalized society in which people have an increasingly narrow sense of belonging. At the fringes, this can funnel disaffection into jihadism on one hand, and into anti-Muslim hatred on the other.\n\nBritain is not divided into warring camps, as some would have it. But the consequences of tribalism can be devastating.\n\nKenan Malik, a writer, lecturer and broadcaster, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Quest for a Moral Compass: A Global History of Ethics\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter."], "summary": ["The real threat to social cohesion is not enmity between Muslims and non-Muslims but a regressive politics of identity."]}, {"title": ["Islamist firebrand draws harsh words, light sentence from UK judge"], "text": ["LONDON \u2013 Firebrand Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary, who radicalized dozens of ISIS recruits including the man believed to have beheaded American journalist James Foley, was sentenced Tuesday to more than 5 years in prison for inciting others to commit acts of terrorism.\n\nIn handing down what was deemed a lenient sentence, Sir Timothy Victor Holroyde, justice of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, Queen\u2019s Bench Division, had harsh words for Choudary, who he said \u201ccrossed the line between the legitimate expression of your own views and a criminal act.\"\n\nHe was facing up to 10 years.\n\n\"A significant proportion of those listening to your words would be impressionable persons looking to you for guidance on how to act,\" he said, noting that the 47-year-old former barrister had failed to condemn \"any aspect\" of what ISIS was doing.\n\n\"In that way you indirectly encouraged violent terrorist activity,\" he said.\n\nChoudary will likely get out in less than the five-and-a-half years to which he was sentenced.\n\nFor 20 years Choudary preached hate on the streets of the UK and Europe, and tried to split Britain along religious lines.

The huge increase last year was also the biggest annual rise since 2001, he said.\n\nThe rise came even as hate crimes against almost all other groups \u2014 including blacks, Hispanics, Jews, gays and whites \u2014 either declined or increased only slightly, his study found. One exception was hate crimes against transgender people, which rose about 40 percent.\n\nAn advance copy of the study was provided to The New York Times.\n\nThe statistics almost certainly understate the extent of the problem, researchers say, because victims are often reluctant to report attacks for fear of inflaming community tensions, and because it is sometimes difficult for investigators to establish that religious, ethnic or racial hatred was a cause.\n\nIn the killing last year of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, N.C., for instance, the authorities did not bring hate crime charges against a neighbor who is charged with murdering them, despite calls from Muslims who said there were religious overtones to the violence. The police said that a parking dispute, not bigotry, may have led to the killings.\n\nSometimes, the evidence is more clear-cut.\n\n\u201cI hate ISLAM!\u201d a former Marine named Ted Hakey Jr. wrote to a friend on Facebook after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris.

And in Queens, a man was beaten in April by three strangers who shouted \u201cISIS, ISIS.\u201d\n\nIn Minneapolis, a man shouting obscenities about Islam shot two Muslim men in traditional religious garb in June, the authorities said.\n\nIn St. Louis, a man was arrested in February after the police said he pointed a gun at a Muslim family shopping on his block and told them they \u201call should die.\u201d\n\nLast month, an imam in Queens and his assistant were shot and killed execution-style on the sidewalk. The authorities have charged a 35-year-old man in the attack but have not determined a motive or whether it should be treated as a hate crime.\n\nThe increase in reports of apparent hate crimes has worried Justice Department officials.\n\n\u201cWe saw it after 9/11, and we continue to see an uptick in allegations of hate-related incidents today following the tragic events over the past year,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, who leads the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division.\n\n\u201cWe see criminal threats against mosques; harassment in schools; and reports of violence targeting Muslim-Americans, Sikhs, people of Arab or South-Asian descent and people perceived to be members of these groups,\u201d Ms. Gupta said.\n\nThe Justice Department has moved to draw public attention to the problem and marshal resources to combat it as part of a broader effort against religious discrimination.\n\nA number of experts in hate crimes said they were concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol may have legitimized threatening or even violent conduct by a small fringe of his supporters.\n\nIn a few cases, people accused of hate crimes against Muslims and others have even cited Mr. Trump.\n\nThe police here in Washington released a videotape in May of a woman who reportedly poured liquid on a Muslim woman after berating Islam and declaring that she was going to vote for Mr. Trump so that he could \u201csend you all back where you came from.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Hillary Clinton charged that Mr. Trump had \u201cincited violence\u201d in a campaign marked by \u201cbigotry\u201d and \u201chatred.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s supporters say that he has never endorsed violence against any minorities, and some conservatives have challenged data showing an increase in violence against American Muslims as a creation of liberal-leaning researchers.\n\nMr. Trump has said he is not responsible for any violence by his supporters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not angry about something I\u2019m saying,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in March. \u201cI\u2019m just a messenger.

A Muslim terrorist slays a non-Muslim citizen in the West, and representatives of the Muslim community rush to dissociate themselves and their faith from the horror. After British soldier Lee Rigby was hacked to death last week in Woolwich in south London, Julie Siddiqi, representing the Islamic Society of Britain, quickly stepped before the microphones to attest that all good Muslims were \"sickened\" by the attack, \"just like everyone else.\"\n\nThis happens every time. Muslim men wearing suits and ties, or women wearing stylish headscarves, are sent out to reassure the world that these attacks have no place in real Islam, that they are aberrations and corruptions of the true faith.\n\nBut then what to make of Omar Bakri? He too claims to speak for the true faith, though he was unavailable for cameras in England last week because the Islamist group he founded, Al-Muhajiroun, was banned in Britain in 2010. Instead, he talked to the media from Tripoli in northern Lebanon, where he now lives. Michael Adebolajo\u2014the accused Woolwich killer who was seen on a video at the scene of the murder, talking to the camera while displaying his bloody hands and a meat cleaver\u2014was Bakri's student a decade ago, before his group was banned. \"A quiet man, very shy, asking lots of questions about Islam,\" Bakri recalled last week. The teacher was impressed to see in the grisly video how far his shy disciple had come, \"standing firm, courageous, brave. Not running away.\"\n\nBakri also told the press: \"The Prophet said an infidel and his killer will not meet in Hell. That's a beautiful saying. May God reward [Adebolajo] for his actions . . . I don't see it as a crime as far as Islam is concerned.\"\n\nThe question requiring an answer at this moment in history is clear: Which group of leaders really speaks for Islam? The officially approved spokesmen for the \"Muslim community\"? Or the manic street preachers of political Islam, who indoctrinate, encourage and train the killers\u2014and then bless their bloodshed?\n\nJulie Siddiqi, executive director of the Islamic Society of Britain; Omar Bakri, a radical Muslim cleric barred from Britain.\n\nIn America, too, the question is pressing. Who speaks for Islam? The Council on American-Islamic Relations, America's largest Muslim civil-liberties advocacy organization? Or one of the many Web-based jihadists who have stepped in to take the place of the late Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born al Qaeda recruiter?\n\nSome refuse even to admit that this is the question on everyone's mind. Amazingly, given the litany of Islamist attacks\u2014from the 9/11 nightmare in America and the London bombings of July 7, 2005, to the slayings at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009, at the Boston Marathon last month and now Woolwich\u2014some continue to deny any link between Islam and terrorism. This week, BBC political editor Nick Robinson had to apologize for saying on the air, as the news in Woolwich broke, that the men who murdered Lee Rigby were \"of Muslim appearance.\"\n\nMemo to the BBC: The killers were shouting \"Allahu akbar\" as they struck. Yet when complaints rained down on the BBC about Mr. Robinson's word choice, he felt obliged to atone. One can only wonder at people who can be so exquisitely sensitive in protecting Islam's reputation yet so utterly desensitized to a hideous murder explicitly committed in the name of Islam.\n\nIn the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing and the Woolwich murder, it was good to hear expressions of horror and sympathy from Islamic spokesmen, but something more is desperately required: genuine recognition of the problem with Islam.\n\nMuslim leaders should ask themselves what exactly their relationship is to a political movement that encourages young men to kill and maim on religious grounds. Think of the Tsarnaev brothers and the way they justified the mayhem they caused in Boston. Ponder carefully the words last week of Michael Adebolajo, his hands splashed with blood: \"We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you. The only reason we have done this is because Muslims are dying every day.\"\n\nMy friend, the Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, was murdered in 2004 for having been insufficiently reverent toward Islam. In the courtroom, the killer looked at Theo's mother and said to her: \"I must confess honestly that I do not empathize with you. I do not feel your pain. . . . I cannot empathize with you because you are an unbeliever.\"\n\nAnd yet, after nearly a decade of similar rhetoric from Islamists around the world, last week the Guardian newspaper could still run a headline quoting a Muslim Londoner: \"These poor idiots have nothing to do with Islam.\" Really? Nothing?\n\nOf course, the overwhelming majority of Muslims are not terrorists or sympathetic to terrorists. Equating all Muslims with terrorism is stupid and wrong. But acknowledging that there is a link between Islam and terror is appropriate and necessary.\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, politicians, academics and the media have shown incredible patience as the drumbeat of Islamist terror attacks continues. When President Obama gave his first statement about the Boston bombings, he didn't mention Islam at all. This week, Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson have repeated the reassuring statements of the Muslim leaders to the effect that Lee Rigby's murder has nothing to do with Islam.\n\nBut many ordinary people hear such statements and scratch their heads in bewilderment. A murderer kills a young father while yelling \"Allahu akbar\" and it's got nothing to do with Islam?\n\nI don't blame Western leaders. They are doing their best to keep the lid on what could become a meltdown of trust between majority populations and Muslim minority communities.\n\nBut I do blame Muslim leaders. It is time they came up with more credible talking points. Their communities have a serious problem. Young people, some of whom are not born into the faith, are being fired up by preachers using basic Islamic scripture and mobilized to wage jihad by radical imams who represent themselves as legitimate Muslim clergymen.\n\nI wonder what would happen if Muslim leaders like Julie Siddiqi started a public and persistent campaign to discredit these Islamist advocates of mayhem and murder. Not just uttering the usual laments after another horrifying attack, but making a constant, high-profile effort to show the world that the preachers of hate are illegitimate.

One example of facts avaiable is the UNHCR report: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,IRBC,,PAK,4562d8cf2,49913b5e59,0.html or from iran: http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=89643&sectionid=351020401\n\nHowever, I do not have to rely on reports. I know many many in Pakistan. Many of my family are still in Pakistan, so please I am quite familiar with the cheap lying and blindness that you exhibit here.\n\nWhat you quoted was from Maududi's Tahfeem Ul Quran and not from the Quran itself. You even complained why I was bringing Maududi's name if you had mentioned that you were quoting the Tahfeem. Either your memory is bad or you lie as most jihadi muslims do when they deal with Kaafir. This habit of lying is being recognized as \"Taqqiya\" by the people here. Taqqiya is shia concept but the tradition of lying in sunni goes more under \"kitman\". And you lie again that there is no agreement among the muslims. All the madhabs agree that apostates are to be killed. There are only one or two writers who argue for not killing of the apostates. Apostates have been killed in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, etc.and recently.\n\nI will not be replying in this thread, since it is closed and hardly anyone will be looking at it anymore.\n\nPosted by: AKafir | January 29, 2010 5:36 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nGo read my post again! I said Dhimmism was a just system compared to what others, Christians for instance, used to follow. The Crusaders proudly claimed that they filled the streets of Jerusalem knee deep with the blood of Saracens (Muslims). They found justifications from Christianity for this carnnage. In Marrat Al Nauman, the Crusaders even ate their muslim prisoners.\n\n\"Some people said that, constrained by the lack of food, they boiled pagan adults in cooking-pots, impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"-----Radulph of Caen\n\nIts not hard to imagine how hatefull apes like you would be jumping up and down, had the Muslim army came even close to these forms of barbarity.

However Pakistan is riven with sectarian hate, and many even consider the 15% of the population who are shia as kaafirs. The shia are blasted regularly around the country. Since Ismailis are part of the shia, in that sense they are also killed by the true believers among the Sunnis.

But I doubt it is for religous reasons. They come done even harder on islamists than on these apostates. Summary executions and life imprisonments is a norm for muslim brotherhood activists. Islam has already declared that there is no compulsion in religion!\n\nI can speak for Pakistan, we consider Ismailis and Ahmedis as apostates. They are a recognized minority and are present in influential Government positions. The Christians are free to build their Churches, carry out their religous practice freely, they have job quotas and reserved seats in the parliament which is in addition to what they can get on their own.\n\nYour hatefilled rant speaks volumes of your ignorance. Dhimmism used to be practiced during middle ages. During that time the Christian Crusaders used to kill all muslim prisoners in any territory they occupied and even ate those people (Ma'arrat al-Numan!). I found Dhimmism to be a just system, but thats a debate for another day. The fact of the matter is that there is no Dhimmism around these days.\n\nThere was no rejection of the UDHR by muslim delegates. The current UDHR is based upon Judeo-Christian Principles. There is nothing wrong with muslim countries demanding that their sensibilities also be taken into account just as those of Jews and Christians. In a democratic system there is nothing wrong in demanding your rights. If the majority of UN feels that this demand is unjustified I believe the muslims would move on. But there's nothing wrong in asking is it?\n\nSo how many muslim countries have you been to? You make pretty stupid generalising statements about status of minorities.

The \"Abrahamic faiths\" aren't quite the same, especially in their view of Abraham.\n\nWhile Christianity accepts the Torah as the Old Testament and just says a new word came through Jesus, Islam claims something else. They rewrote both books, saying Christianity and Judaism lied about Abraham, Moses, Jesus and much of the rest of the books.\n\nIslam has a very different interpretation and it can't be lumped in the same category as Judaism and Christianity.\n\nBoth Islam and Judaism (and, thus, Christianity) are considered \"Abrahamic faiths,\" in that they stem from a connection to Abraham as described in the Torah, the Bible, and the Qu'ran. Since Islam is predominantly an Arabic religion, it has been concluded that Islam stems from Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham and half-brother of Isaac father of Jacob (later named Israel).\n\nThe following verses from Quran proves the point ....\n\nAnd He(Allah) taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: \"Tell me the names of these if ye are right.\" ( Quran,Al-Baqara, Chapter #2, Verse #31)\n\nAllah did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of 'Imran above all people,- ( Quran,Aal-e-Imran, Chapter #3, Verse #33)\n\nWe(Allah) have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. ( Quran,An-Nisa, Chapter #4, Verse #163)\n\nAnd remember We(Allah) took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant: ( Quran,Al-Ahzab, Chapter #33, Verse #7)\n\nThe only \"ignorance\" here is Christians trying to disown Islam as a part of their intolerant common Abrahamic \"my-way-or-the highway\" denominator.\n\nPosted by: coloradodog | January 27, 2010 11:05 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nHirsi Ali says it well: ************* http://www.aei.org/article/100627 Nowhere in the world is bigotry so rampant as in Muslim countries. No difference is greater between American and Islamic principles than the founding ideals of both. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of Islam that al-Qa'ida and other Muslim puritans insist on the implementation of sharia law, jihad and the eternal subjection of women. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of America that blacks and women fought for--and gained--equal rights and gays and new immigrants continue to do so.\n\nI would include Thomas Jefferson's improvements on the New Testament. The king, the sheik and the ayatollah have the authority to rule that parts of the Koran no longer apply in the modern world. For instance, the edicts of sharia law that reject scientific inquiry and order all Muslims to spread Islam.\n\nAnd of course, no reading selection would be complete without a copy of the US Constitution, highlighting (because you can do that in a Kindle) the Eighth Amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAnd for good measure, I would also add John F.Kennedy's inaugural address: \"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. . . . To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required. . . . To those nations who would make themselves our adversary . . . we dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. . . . Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\" Not to mention woman.\n\nI wish he [Obama] would host a reading summit where we truly \"say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts that too often are said only behind closed doors\".

Infidels under Muslim rule are ritually and legally mistreated in the name of Allah by Sharia law. Muslims have proudly documented the long history of such Dhimmitude and they were the ones who first made Jews wear yellow symbols of identification on clothing, long before Germany did.\n\nIslam has three ordered choices it offers conquered infidels: Conversion, acceptance of Dhimmi status and death. Is it any real wonder why many of the indigenous people conquered by Jihad accepted conversion in order to escape the later two choices?\n\nThat also goes back to one of my original points. There's no such thing a \"moderate Islamic countries\" when all unanimously reject the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and support The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam.

Go to the link he gives for the poll. Look at the chart on page 7. The responders seem to dislike Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism at around the same percentage. Yes, Christianity is in the mix. Muslims, on the other had, are disliked at a much higher rate.\n\nCould it be because Jihad declared a war on the West and Muslims have been killing and trying to kill us for decades? No, says Patel, it's because we also hate Jews. Sorry, doesn't follow.\n\nOn page eight, they switch from the religions to people who follow the religion. The pattern remains. There's a major statistical difference between dislike of Muslims and the other religious adherents.\n\nOn page 13, the study tries to link the prejudice against Jews with that against Muslims. Notice a religion disappears: Buddhism. Gosh, could it be that fundamentalist Christians dislike ALL other religions? It would seem reasonable, but since the apologist group behind the study wants to create a specific link, that aspect is not discussed.\n\nFinally, notice the point about Americans not knowing about Islam. That's true. What the creators of the apologia miss is that helps them. For instance, a lot of Americans claim Muslims want peace while the group claims most Muslims want equality. However, the Organization of the Islamic Conferences, representing fifty-seven Muslim nations, openly rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and unanimously proposed The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam.

You can't run for election in this country unless you publicly profess some sort of religiuosity, most preferably of the Christian brand. Doesn't matter if you personally believe what you profess. What matters is that you profess it, and loudly.

There were people involved in those acts who felt God & Jesus were blessing their actions, but you didn't see the entire population jump up and say \"Doing this is God's will.\"\n\nWorld War One did not occur because of Christ, it occurred because a Serbian nationalist/irredentist/whatever-ist shot the Archduke Ferdinand. That in and of itself didn't cause the war - indeed, the upper circles of the Austrian government didn't exactly mourn the Archduke's passing. However, elements within the government saw an excellent excuse to engage in a war to destroy Serbia. That, and a mishmash of entangling alliances in Europe, led to a succession of declaration of wars when Austria went to war. Those were hardly the only factors involved - nationalism, unresolved territorial disputes, arms races, etc., all contributed as well. There was very little overt religious reasoning.\n\nThe nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not conducted because the Japanese weren't Christians. They were conducted because an invasion of the Home Islands ('mainland' Japan) had casualty estimates - for the Allies alone - ranging from the hundreds of thousands to the MILLIONS. Using the bombs would only put a few bomber crews and their fighter escorts at risk; and it was hoped that obliterating one or two cities would shock the Emperor into surrendering before the bloodbath of an invasion became necessary. Personally, I agree with Truman's decision to use atomic weapons.\n\nHolding all Christians responsible for such events would be like holding all Muslims responsible for the cowards who strap bombs to their chests and blow up unarmed civilians.

No.\n\nPosted by: SeaTigr | January 27, 2010 11:54 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nBy the way a Muslim country Turkey, the Ottoman empire was part of WWI - if you are going to defend Islam as peaceful know your history - the Turks committed atrocities against the christian people under their thumb for hundreds of years.\n\nIts called Prima Noctura - rape the christian bride on her wedding night - if we want to talk history its going to get worse and worse.\n\nPosted by: agapn9 | January 27, 2010 11:52 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nMuslims have a very aggressive culture.

Muslims and Jews are very strongly monotheistic while Christians believe in a three pronged God. The central figure in Christianity is the God-Man figure of Jesus. Ask any Jew or Muslim if they believe that Jesus was God in human flesh who ran afoul of the authorities and was executed. They will most emphatically say that Jesus was a man and not a God. This is diametrically opposed to the central believ of Christianity. Each religion thinks it is the true one and that the others are misguided or downright false. The other major religions (Hinduism for example) have an entirely different idea of God. Let's stop repeating the nonsense that we all worship the same God.

Indeed the new comer has paid the green-back dollars to acquire or rent that property but this fact is often overlooked. Old is gold, so think the older residents. The New may be Platinum for all you know. I don't care - that attitude is a road block in beginning a communication. One wonders why the friendly instinct of welcoming a new neighbour takes a back seat these days when you and I need it most. COMPASSION The youth is driven by Passion. If there is a sweet little chick in the new flock, the boys of nubile age think of dating her - not with the intention of taking her to altar but with the not so sacred instinct of taking her to bed sooner or later. That is not the human spirit. That is the animal instinct. We all behave as animals sometime or the other. It is the correct education that purifies and reforms our baser instincts and makes a man out of an animal. MANURBHAV The Vedas, most ancient scriptures in the library of mankind advise all men and women to be good Human Beings.Among the many qualities of a Human Being isCompassion or in Sanskrit, KARUNA. If my heart bleeds for the man or the woman next door when she needs help, I have risen to the status of a Human after sublimating my animal instincts. I have risen higher than what the old saying demanded of me. A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED - that is the age-old adage. Going to the help of a neighbour, a fellow man, even before making friends with him or her is a step higher than what was required of me, a neighbour, in the saying on friendship.Going into that direction further, one may even go to rescue a damsel in distress and that would indeed be an act of a good human being. One need not be a Knight in shining armor on a white horse to prove to the humanity his Humane qualities. This may be done in a lane or a bylane where the poor, the needy and the deprived men and women live. Let us obey the Vedic injunction \"MANURBHAV'and be true to our Dharma or the code of conduct to live and let live in a human society.God treats all human beings as His sons and daughters and does not differentiate between votaries of one religion and another. ______________________________ UPVANOM, 609, Sector 29, NOIDA - 201303, INDIA.

That ideology has mass murderers (Osama Bin Laden), ordinary murderers (abortion doctor killers and those who deprive sick children of medical care) and garden variety haters (Pat Robertson and his ilk). Only rarely do mainstream religious leaders fight back or even condemn this evil. They do not do so because under the hood of every religious belief in the world is the theological notion that \"I am right. I know God's will and you are therefore wrong.\" Fundamentalism assaulted will yield religion destroyed is the unspoken fear. So the great churches sit in silence.

One of my more infamous ancestors coined the phrase, \"Kill them all - Let God sort them out,\" when he ordered the massacre of the entire population of a French town because he had heard that there were some heretics living in the town. Motivations have always seemed to be the same, e.g., power, wealth, and women, although I have no doubt that some cult leaders are criminally insane.

In the case of Jews and Muslims, the conflict stems from each group having an entitlement agenda that is fundamentally incompatible with the other.\n\nThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that every individual who identifies themselves as a Muslim or a Jew necessarily subscribes to the group agenda. It just means that for Jews who do, they believe that their religious/ethnic identity entitles them to take possession of Israel/Palestine to the dispossession of others.\n\nFor Muslims, it is the entitlement to see that their religion is the predominant faith everywhere. It is the resistance to those agendas that engenders hatred and fuels conflict. The Muslims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agenda is much more comprehensive and is therefore perceived to be the greater threat to the world at large.

Anti-semitism is hatred of a \"people\", of real people who can get hurt. The equivalent would be hatred of muslims, and around the world the non-muslims bend over backword to show that their cultures and their ideologies do not even discriminate against muslims. This is opposed to the deeply deeply biased and discriminatory laws on the books of all Islamic countries against the non-muslims.\n\nI am an apostate of Islam and I think it is justified to criticize and expose the hatred against the Kaafir that is imbedded in Islam. Hating Islam is hating an ideology. It is okay to hate Nazism. It is okay to hate Islam. It is not okay to generalize that to the people, the muslims. We are at war with the Jihadist who in my opinion are the true believers of the words of the Quran, and are the one who reflect the ideology of Islam in its pure form. It is okay to hate those who kill because their ideology tells them to kill kaafirs. I have no desire to tolerate an Abdul Muttalib who wanted to kill the hundreds flying on that plane. What ever ideology drove him to want to kill those people should be hated. He says that that ideology is Islam.

The facts are relatively straightforward compared to 9/11. If it could be shown that the anthrax attacks originated from the US government or agents thereof, it would produce a massive shift in the public's thinking.

Most people are good people. Most muslims are good people. But their are too many violent muslims today and throughout history. Good muslims are good in spite of the supremacist and narrow-minded ideology found in the Koran and Hadith. The good find the good in the Koran and ignore the bad, which is nice. The problem is there is too much justification for acts of violence against nonbelievers (kafirs) in the Koran and in the culture & history of Islam. This has to be addressed and cannot be ignored. step 1: ackowledge there is a problem. step 2: try to fix the problem.\n\nWe seem to be stuck on step 1 with the \"Rodney King\" approach. Please try to tell the Al Queda, Taliban & suicide bombers that \"we must reject hate\". Good Luck. Sadly, step 2 will also be a problem. If a few things in the Koran need to changed, can it be done? No. The Koran says many nice things, but it also says some bad and violent things regarding women & nonbelievers.

They are not in the same league.\n\nIt is a fatally false assumption that prejudice, per se, is a bad thing. We are prejudiced against Nazis, against white racists, against black racists, against Communists, against Ku Klux Klan members -- and everyone thinks that is perfectly o.k. And, it is o.k.!!! It is always o.k. to be prejudiced against members of a group and adherents of an ideology whose values are inimical to ours. Not only is it o.k.; but it is morally right. In the case of Islam, it is clear that Islamic values are inimical to ours. One need only read the Koran, the sayings of Muhammad, Sharia law and the writings of the great Islamic religious authorities, the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. When a person says that he/she is Moslem, it is reasonable to infer that this person accepts and promotes the doctrines of Islam which are based on violent religious bigotry toward all non-Moslems. Now, we know that there are many Moslems who do NOT favor those Islamic doctrines. They exist -- just like there were many members of the Nazi party and the Soviet Communist party who did not support the doctrines of those parties. The problem is: how do we know in advance which members of the group truly support the doctrines of the group? We cannot know in advance. That is where prejudice comes in. ALL members of a subversive group should be under suspicion of supporting the doctrines of that group -- until proven otherwise. Failure to exercise proper prejudice and suspicion has already cost us thousands of innocent lives -- think 9/11, Ft. Hood, the London bombing, the Madrid bombing, the Bali bombing, the Mumbai massacre, and so on and so on. Prejudice against members of a group, based on knowledge of the principles of the group, is perfectly reasonable. Let us work to educate Americans so that the percentage of those prejudiced against Moslems will increase! Those Moslems who do not share the violent religious bigotry of Islam can help us be being vocal about their rejection of those parts of the Koran, Hadith and Sharia which promote violent religious bigotry. Reasonable prejudice is a matter of life and death. It is elementary self-defense.\n\nPosted by: Montedoro | January 26, 2010 7:52 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nWell EP is trying to be egalitarian.

And while some have done evil in the name of Judaism, that is not truly Judaism. Likewise, while some have done evil in the name of Christianity, that is not truly Christianity.\n\nWe must get past the fear and ignorance that breeds hate. We must reject hate. We must embrace those of all religions (and those of no religion) with respect and compassion.\n\nAnd we must not resort to religious bias to avoid dealing with the very real political/social/environmental problems that are the source of the estrangement between peoples and religions.

Today, however, there are armed Muslim groups seeking to acquire nuclear and biological weapons to destroy the city I live in, and putting bombs in their clothing to kill me while I am on an airplane. To my knowledge, neither the Baptists, the Mormons or the Jews are engaged in this activity, which is known to regular folks as \"terrorism\" or \"war\" or \"mass murder\".

How many times have we seen reports of Imams spouting hatred from the pulpits of the world and nothing is done to stop them?

All religions seem to be opposed to the truly open society. The relative simplicity of Islamic theology--its greater rationality, if I might somewhat abuse the term, compared with, say, trinitarianism--supports a totalitarian vision of theocracy. Divinely led authorities can, of course, never be wrong. (Contrast this view with that of the Founders, who understood that people are fallible and that factions are corrupt and set ambition to check ambition, and created institutional checks to the assumption of total power.) With the recent report that al Qaeda is determined on a MWD attack in the US, it seems that al Qaeda is bent on an apocalyptic confrontation between Islam and the modern world.\n\nI would only point out that in the wake of a large-scale attack on the US, it would loom large in the thinking of whatever militant group eventually came to power that Meccans and Tehranis don't vote in American elections. Also that it is probably a lot easier to break a country than to take it over. There is a lot of anger in the US right now, and another big attack could easily result in a tea-party-type President committed to a fundamentalist apocalypticism. What would be the domestic cost to such a President of striking out against Muslim countries? Zippo, I submit. The fulminating anti-semitism of the Muslim world is not a good sign.

The Protocols is standard fare.\n\nThe ranting against Christians both inside mosques and without, the oppression, the violence in Pakistan, Egypt, etc., is also everywhere present.\n\nNo rabbi would last two minutes if he began spouting hate from the \"pulpit\" against any group on the face of the earth. It may not be. It would be considered a defilement.\n\nWhen Muslims the world over take that same position, dialogue could open. Unfortunately, those who attempt it are often the victims of oppression, occasionally serious.\n\nIn the meantime, Eboo, I would be interested in knowing your thoughts about the displacement, forced exile of the remaining Jews of Yemen.\n\nI can also tell you this.

Since Islam is predominantly an Arabic religion, it has been concluded that Islam stems from Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham and half-brother of Isaac father of Jacob (later named Israel).\n\nThe following verses from Quran proves the point ....\n\nAnd He(Allah) taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: \"Tell me the names of these if ye are right.\" ( Quran,Al-Baqara, Chapter #2, Verse #31)\n\nAllah did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of 'Imran above all people,- ( Quran,Aal-e-Imran, Chapter #3, Verse #33)\n\nWe(Allah) have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms. ( Quran,An-Nisa, Chapter #4, Verse #163)\n\nAnd remember We(Allah) took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant: ( Quran,Al-Ahzab, Chapter #33, Verse #7)\n\nThe only \"ignorance\" here is Christians trying to disown Islam as a part of their intolerant common Abrahamic \"my-way-or-the highway\" denominator.\n\nPosted by: coloradodog | January 27, 2010 11:05 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nHirsi Ali says it well: ************* http://www.aei.org/article/100627 Nowhere in the world is bigotry so rampant as in Muslim countries. No difference is greater between American and Islamic principles than the founding ideals of both. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of Islam that al-Qa'ida and other Muslim puritans insist on the implementation of sharia law, jihad and the eternal subjection of women. It is on the basis of the founding ideals of America that blacks and women fought for--and gained--equal rights and gays and new immigrants continue to do so.\n\nI would include Thomas Jefferson's improvements on the New Testament. The king, the sheik and the ayatollah have the authority to rule that parts of the Koran no longer apply in the modern world. For instance, the edicts of sharia law that reject scientific inquiry and order all Muslims to spread Islam.\n\nAnd of course, no reading selection would be complete without a copy of the US Constitution, highlighting (because you can do that in a Kindle) the Eighth Amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAnd for good measure, I would also add John F.Kennedy's inaugural address: \"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. . . . To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required. . . . To those nations who would make themselves our adversary . . . we dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. . . . Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\" Not to mention woman.\n\nI wish he [Obama] would host a reading summit where we truly \"say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts that too often are said only behind closed doors\". For too many of us born into Islam, saying those things openly can land us in jail or in the graveyard. *********************\n\nPosted by: AKafir | January 27, 2010 6:55 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nOh, and while we're discussing conversions, let's discuss Dhimmitude. Infidels under Muslim rule are ritually and legally mistreated in the name of Allah by Sharia law. Muslims have proudly documented the long history of such Dhimmitude and they were the ones who first made Jews wear yellow symbols of identification on clothing, long before Germany did.\n\nIslam has three ordered choices it offers conquered infidels: Conversion, acceptance of Dhimmi status and death. Is it any real wonder why many of the indigenous people conquered by Jihad accepted conversion in order to escape the later two choices?\n\nThat also goes back to one of my original points. There's no such thing a \"moderate Islamic countries\" when all unanimously reject the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and support The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam.

Sadly, he shows that statistics is another area of ignorance.As the main body of people hating Jews today is the Muslim World, his initial presence falls flat on its face.\n\nSadly, though, Patel's main problem isn't ignorance, it's intentional propaganda, his usual tool. Go to the link he gives for the poll. Look at the chart on page 7. The responders seem to dislike Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism at around the same percentage. Yes, Christianity is in the mix. Muslims, on the other had, are disliked at a much higher rate.\n\nCould it be because Jihad declared a war on the West and Muslims have been killing and trying to kill us for decades? No, says Patel, it's because we also hate Jews. Sorry, doesn't follow.\n\nOn page eight, they switch from the religions to people who follow the religion. The pattern remains. There's a major statistical difference between dislike of Muslims and the other religious adherents.\n\nOn page 13, the study tries to link the prejudice against Jews with that against Muslims. Notice a religion disappears: Buddhism. Gosh, could it be that fundamentalist Christians dislike ALL other religions? It would seem reasonable, but since the apologist group behind the study wants to create a specific link, that aspect is not discussed.\n\nFinally, notice the point about Americans not knowing about Islam. That's true. What the creators of the apologia miss is that helps them. For instance, a lot of Americans claim Muslims want peace while the group claims most Muslims want equality. However, the Organization of the Islamic Conferences, representing fifty-seven Muslim nations, openly rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and unanimously proposed The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. That claims that the only rights that exist are the ones Muslims grant people through Sharia law.\n\nThat is not equality, that is not peaceful, that is reality -- A reality neither Patel nor the folks who massaged the polls want people to see.\n\nPosted by: groucho42 | January 27, 2010 1:38 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nIslam is a gutter 'religion' that promotes death, violence, and the subjugation of women.\n\nPosted by: tjhall1 | January 27, 2010 1:25 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\n\u00c2\u00abPeople who hate Jews also hate Muslims.\u00c2\u00bb Posted by Eboo Patel | January 25, 2010; 9:28 AM ET\n\nO Eboo, *some* people who hate Jews also hate Muslims.

That in and of itself didn't cause the war - indeed, the upper circles of the Austrian government didn't exactly mourn the Archduke's passing. However, elements within the government saw an excellent excuse to engage in a war to destroy Serbia. That, and a mishmash of entangling alliances in Europe, led to a succession of declaration of wars when Austria went to war. Those were hardly the only factors involved - nationalism, unresolved territorial disputes, arms races, etc., all contributed as well. There was very little overt religious reasoning.\n\nThe nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not conducted because the Japanese weren't Christians. They were conducted because an invasion of the Home Islands ('mainland' Japan) had casualty estimates - for the Allies alone - ranging from the hundreds of thousands to the MILLIONS.

Muslims and Jews are very strongly monotheistic while Christians believe in a three pronged God. The central figure in Christianity is the God-Man figure of Jesus. Ask any Jew or Muslim if they believe that Jesus was God in human flesh who ran afoul of the authorities and was executed. They will most emphatically say that Jesus was a man and not a God. This is diametrically opposed to the central believ of Christianity. Each religion thinks it is the true one and that the others are misguided or downright false. The other major religions (Hinduism for example) have an entirely different idea of God. Let's stop repeating the nonsense that we all worship the same God. We do not and the other religions and their Gods are obviously false to a true believer\n\nPosted by: edzed | January 27, 2010 10:09 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nHere's an idea...teach the human race the futility of attempting to define an unfathomable supreme entity.

You must PICK someone who you think is a good person, and they will translate it. You cant just flip to a page and read something, and take it for what it says. The koran CLEARLY states that all religions should be respected. Jews think that they are suffering...ok lets flip the numbers than. We will kill one jew for each palestinian that has died. Do you honestly think that the numbers of jews killed to the numbers of palestinians is even remotely close? Im not talking about the holocaust, im talking about israel vs palestine. Please stop reading the koran if all your going to do is translate it the wrong way. Israel will always be mad about the holocaust. well guess what, who cares? You idiots havent even captured all the BAD natzis yet and your already wreaking havoc the less muslim world. IF you want to hate, hate britian for surrounding you by muslim states, and hate the germans for displacing you in the first place. You have no reason to hate muslims yet you do. If your a jew who just doesnt care about all this, then im in the same boat s you. HOwever if you are a jew who is going to talk about the koran negatively, im going to educate you on how to talk with respect and knowledge, and how to point your anger to the people who actually deserve your bad intentions. Argentina for giving the natzis a home, costa rica for givin the natzis a home, chile for giving the natzis a home. Go chase down bruner, the true hater of jews. I dont understand how after being so happy living spread out through europe, you can make the claim that islam is to blame. Palestinians are wondering...where the hell did these people come from, and why are they creating there own state, and throwing us out of it? and then creating their own government to chase down natzis, or at lest pretend like they are, while they accumulate arms and wealth to restart the war they have always wanted the fight, they just never had the power to do so. Now that they do, they are causing trouble throughout the region which was once much more stable, before the ww2. I blame israel for all the violence, everytime they kill palestinians, they are just creating more and more antisentiment, and they dont care, but then they complain when people talk badly about their agenda.

Indeed the new comer has paid the green-back dollars to acquire or rent that property but this fact is often overlooked. Old is gold, so think the older residents. The New may be Platinum for all you know. I don't care - that attitude is a road block in beginning a communication. One wonders why the friendly instinct of welcoming a new neighbour takes a back seat these days when you and I need it most. COMPASSION The youth is driven by Passion. If there is a sweet little chick in the new flock, the boys of nubile age think of dating her - not with the intention of taking her to altar but with the not so sacred instinct of taking her to bed sooner or later. That is not the human spirit. That is the animal instinct. We all behave as animals sometime or the other. It is the correct education that purifies and reforms our baser instincts and makes a man out of an animal. MANURBHAV The Vedas, most ancient scriptures in the library of mankind advise all men and women to be good Human Beings.Among the many qualities of a Human Being isCompassion or in Sanskrit, KARUNA. If my heart bleeds for the man or the woman next door when she needs help, I have risen to the status of a Human after sublimating my animal instincts. I have risen higher than what the old saying demanded of me. A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED - that is the age-old adage. Going to the help of a neighbour, a fellow man, even before making friends with him or her is a step higher than what was required of me, a neighbour, in the saying on friendship.Going into that direction further, one may even go to rescue a damsel in distress and that would indeed be an act of a good human being. One need not be a Knight in shining armor on a white horse to prove to the humanity his Humane qualities. This may be done in a lane or a bylane where the poor, the needy and the deprived men and women live. Let us obey the Vedic injunction \"MANURBHAV'and be true to our Dharma or the code of conduct to live and let live in a human society.God treats all human beings as His sons and daughters and does not differentiate between votaries of one religion and another. ______________________________ UPVANOM, 609, Sector 29, NOIDA - 201303, INDIA.

That ideology has mass murderers (Osama Bin Laden), ordinary murderers (abortion doctor killers and those who deprive sick children of medical care) and garden variety haters (Pat Robertson and his ilk). Only rarely do mainstream religious leaders fight back or even condemn this evil. They do not do so because under the hood of every religious belief in the world is the theological notion that \"I am right. I know God's will and you are therefore wrong.\" Fundamentalism assaulted will yield religion destroyed is the unspoken fear. So the great churches sit in silence.

The Christians at one time had their own version of the Taliban. They were known as Crusaders. Before they became involved fighting Muslims, they hunted down and killed other Christians who they viewed as heretics. Many people cloak themselves in religion in order to justify their evil deeds. One of my more infamous ancestors coined the phrase, \"Kill them all - Let God sort them out,\" when he ordered the massacre of the entire population of a French town because he had heard that there were some heretics living in the town. Motivations have always seemed to be the same, e.g., power, wealth, and women, although I have no doubt that some cult leaders are criminally insane. Charismatic leaders always seem to draw in followers, many of whom seem to welcome religion as an excuse to abuse other people, and others who are misquided into thinking that they will reap great rewards in the hereafter.\n\nPosted by: FredinVicksburg | January 27, 2010 3:12 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nYassirYousufi: \"Kafir is a Ayyan Hirsi Ali Inspired Hindu whacko masquerading as a muslim apostate because he thinks it sounds cool to be an apostate and no body will be able to guess his true identity!\"\n\nI may be a vulcun or a klingon or even a 10 foot Navi.

In the case of Jews and Muslims, the conflict stems from each group having an entitlement agenda that is fundamentally incompatible with the other.\n\nThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that every individual who identifies themselves as a Muslim or a Jew necessarily subscribes to the group agenda. It just means that for Jews who do, they believe that their religious/ethnic identity entitles them to take possession of Israel/Palestine to the dispossession of others.\n\nFor Muslims, it is the entitlement to see that their religion is the predominant faith everywhere. It is the resistance to those agendas that engenders hatred and fuels conflict. The Muslims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agenda is much more comprehensive and is therefore perceived to be the greater threat to the world at large. Beyond that, there is the content of Islamic scripture, which features justification for many draconian social restrictions and sanctions.\n\nI would probably be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause if they were not wedded to a to a religious tradition that takes its intolerance seriously. Zionism is sort of like affirmative action to aid a group that has suffered much and could really use a safe haven.

The facts are relatively straightforward compared to 9/11. If it could be shown that the anthrax attacks originated from the US government or agents thereof, it would produce a massive shift in the public's thinking. People would then be forced to accept the fact that they have been lied to and the country was attacked through an inside job. That would open up, in my opinion, a huge opportunity to expose the truth about 9/11.\n\nPosted by: visit_iamthewitnessdotcom | January 26, 2010 9:45 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nI'm sure you mean well, but denial and pretending a problem does not exist is not the answer. Actually, this is making the problem of Islamic terrorism worse.\n\nOf course, people who happen to be born into a muslim family like Eboo Patel (or Yasseryousufi) will have the need to defend Islam because it is a part of their identity. Most people are good people. Most muslims are good people. But their are too many violent muslims today and throughout history. Good muslims are good in spite of the supremacist and narrow-minded ideology found in the Koran and Hadith. The good find the good in the Koran and ignore the bad, which is nice. The problem is there is too much justification for acts of violence against nonbelievers (kafirs) in the Koran and in the culture & history of Islam. This has to be addressed and cannot be ignored. step 1: ackowledge there is a problem. step 2: try to fix the problem.\n\nWe seem to be stuck on step 1 with the \"Rodney King\" approach. Please try to tell the Al Queda, Taliban & suicide bombers that \"we must reject hate\". Good Luck. Sadly, step 2 will also be a problem. If a few things in the Koran need to changed, can it be done? No. The Koran says many nice things, but it also says some bad and violent things regarding women & nonbelievers. Some religions allow for discussion and evolution; others are the rigid word of God and cannot be questioned (Islam & Christianity).\n\nSo, thanks for the nice thoughts, but some of us are trying to cause real change and progress, even if its unpleasant.\n\nPosted by: clearthinking1 | January 26, 2010 9:45 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nPrejudice against Muslims and prejudice against Jews are not the same thing. They are not in the same league.\n\nIt is a fatally false assumption that prejudice, per se, is a bad thing. We are prejudiced against Nazis, against white racists, against black racists, against Communists, against Ku Klux Klan members -- and everyone thinks that is perfectly o.k. And, it is o.k.!!! It is always o.k. to be prejudiced against members of a group and adherents of an ideology whose values are inimical to ours. Not only is it o.k.; but it is morally right. In the case of Islam, it is clear that Islamic values are inimical to ours. One need only read the Koran, the sayings of Muhammad, Sharia law and the writings of the great Islamic religious authorities, the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. When a person says that he/she is Moslem, it is reasonable to infer that this person accepts and promotes the doctrines of Islam which are based on violent religious bigotry toward all non-Moslems. Now, we know that there are many Moslems who do NOT favor those Islamic doctrines. They exist -- just like there were many members of the Nazi party and the Soviet Communist party who did not support the doctrines of those parties. The problem is: how do we know in advance which members of the group truly support the doctrines of the group? We cannot know in advance. That is where prejudice comes in. ALL members of a subversive group should be under suspicion of supporting the doctrines of that group -- until proven otherwise. Failure to exercise proper prejudice and suspicion has already cost us thousands of innocent lives -- think 9/11, Ft. Hood, the London bombing, the Madrid bombing, the Bali bombing, the Mumbai massacre, and so on and so on. Prejudice against members of a group, based on knowledge of the principles of the group, is perfectly reasonable. Let us work to educate Americans so that the percentage of those prejudiced against Moslems will increase! Those Moslems who do not share the violent religious bigotry of Islam can help us be being vocal about their rejection of those parts of the Koran, Hadith and Sharia which promote violent religious bigotry. Reasonable prejudice is a matter of life and death. It is elementary self-defense.\n\nPosted by: Montedoro | January 26, 2010 7:52 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nWell EP is trying to be egalitarian.

And anyone who justifies their hate with religion commits a double evil.\n\nNo religion advocates hate. Rather, all religions advocate respect, compassion, generosity, and love towards others. That includes Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.\n\nWhile it is true that some have done evil in the name of Islam, that is not truly Islam. And while some have done evil in the name of Judaism, that is not truly Judaism. Likewise, while some have done evil in the name of Christianity, that is not truly Christianity.\n\nWe must get past the fear and ignorance that breeds hate. We must reject hate. We must embrace those of all religions (and those of no religion) with respect and compassion.\n\nAnd we must not resort to religious bias to avoid dealing with the very real political/social/environmental problems that are the source of the estrangement between peoples and religions.

To know the unique aspects of the Baptist belief system was to know some arcane, marginal information safely disregarded in most contexts. Similarly, Muslims appeared in Sinbad and some Peter OToole movie, but could otherwise be safely disregarded on an operational level. Today, however, there are armed Muslim groups seeking to acquire nuclear and biological weapons to destroy the city I live in, and putting bombs in their clothing to kill me while I am on an airplane. To my knowledge, neither the Baptists, the Mormons or the Jews are engaged in this activity, which is known to regular folks as \"terrorism\" or \"war\" or \"mass murder\".

Hatred is espoused in the Koran despite the public pronouncements of Islam being a \"peaceful religion.\" All the ecumenical-like statements of tolerance and foreswearing violence from Muslim leaders mean nothing unless they and their Muslims co-religionists fight the extremists. How many times have we seen reports of Imams spouting hatred from the pulpits of the world and nothing is done to stop them? The conclusion drawn is obvious: Muslims are too afraid of their co-religionists; or they believe in the hatred espoused as the divine word voiced by their religious leaders.\n\nYou can believe the world may one day truly evolve into that ideal state where \"the lamb lies down with the lion\" in peace and harmony.

All religions seem to be opposed to the truly open society. The relative simplicity of Islamic theology--its greater rationality, if I might somewhat abuse the term, compared with, say, trinitarianism--supports a totalitarian vision of theocracy. Divinely led authorities can, of course, never be wrong. (Contrast this view with that of the Founders, who understood that people are fallible and that factions are corrupt and set ambition to check ambition, and created institutional checks to the assumption of total power.) With the recent report that al Qaeda is determined on a MWD attack in the US, it seems that al Qaeda is bent on an apocalyptic confrontation between Islam and the modern world.\n\nI would only point out that in the wake of a large-scale attack on the US, it would loom large in the thinking of whatever militant group eventually came to power that Meccans and Tehranis don't vote in American elections. Also that it is probably a lot easier to break a country than to take it over. There is a lot of anger in the US right now, and another big attack could easily result in a tea-party-type President committed to a fundamentalist apocalypticism. What would be the domestic cost to such a President of striking out against Muslim countries? Zippo, I submit. The fulminating anti-semitism of the Muslim world is not a good sign.

When someone in your synagogue says something ugly about Muslims, know that he is marshaling the forces of anti-Semitism. When someone in your mosque speaks hatefully about Jews, know that he is putting your Muslim children more at risk.\n\nFor the purposes of prejudice, the terms 'dirty Muslim' and 'dirty Jew' are virtually interchangeable. I suggest we drop them from our vocabulary. If not for the sake of other people's kids, at least do it for your own. ------------------------------ Here is the problem with this segment of your analysis. More on the rest at a later date. Mullahs all over the world--in the Middle East, in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, spout antisemitic filth during services.\n\nIn fact, I have friends both here and abroad who wait in their cars until the filth part ends so that they can enter the mosque and pray.\n\nThis is no secret Eboo, and, sadly, pretending that the situation is otherwise will not change things. How could it? Throughout the MIddle East, Asia, and parts of Africa antisemitism is part of the official discourse, present in local and state-run newspapers, television shows, in films, including the notorious Rothchild nonsense. The Protocols is standard fare.\n\nThe ranting against Christians both inside mosques and without, the oppression, the violence in Pakistan, Egypt, etc., is also everywhere present.\n\nNo rabbi would last two minutes if he began spouting hate from the \"pulpit\" against any group on the face of the earth. It may not be. It would be considered a defilement.\n\nWhen Muslims the world over take that same position, dialogue could open. Unfortunately, those who attempt it are often the victims of oppression, occasionally serious.\n\nIn the meantime, Eboo, I would be interested in knowing your thoughts about the displacement, forced exile of the remaining Jews of Yemen.\n\nI can also tell you this. I loathe bigotry with every fiber that comprises my being. HOwever, I long ago recognized that one does not fight fire with a cup of water. For Jews, the house is always on fire or about to be burned.\n\nFrance will be Judenrein in my lifetime. Jews are slowly leaving England. Why is that Eboo? Let's be friends would be great.

Many other similar teachings from Mohamed and Islamic scholars are written in the Koran and Hadith. In Islamic law (sharia), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be put to death unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress.

Grief transcends the boundaries of race and creed and it is with great sadness that we see how mindless violence has filled the last week.\n\nIt began with the murder of three young Americans in Chapel Hill in North Carolina, apparently because of their Muslim faith, and ended on Saturday night with shootings at a cafe and synagogue in Copenhagen. Muslims killed in Pakistan and Egyptian Christians in Libya only add to the rising death toll. These attacks reflect the worst in our society and I worry that the actions of a few who are intent on killing for no obvious reason other than hatred for the victims\u2019 background, beliefs or points of view is creating fear that divides communities.\n\nRelated: Copenhagen attacks: Danish police charge two men\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain, of which I am secretary general, has consistently condemned violence, regardless of the identity of the perpetrator or victim. Our faith, like all faiths, is clear that no amount of dislike for a person\u2019s belief ever justifies the taking of a life. Such acts of terror should face the full force of the law. But simply bringing the criminals to justice is not enough in itself.\n\nThe best way to defeat their hatred is to bring even stronger bonds between communities here in Britain. This is why, while we were deeply offended by the deliberate insults of Charlie Hebdo magazine, we condemned without equivocation the brutal attack in Paris. Our response to these insults was instead to mobilise imams (Muslim theological leaders) across the UK to express our deep sadness at the caricature of the Prophet Muhammad in newspapers in the UK for the first time, while exemplifying his ideals by rejecting any violent response. In addition, we organised an interfaith solidarity summit to show the world that terrorists should never divide us, and launched the #VisitMyMosque open day which sought to break the negativity around Muslims by demonstrating openness and transparency. To celebrate the United Nations Interfaith Week 2015, our major affiliate, Muslim Council of Wales, demonstrated historic brotherhood between Jews and Muslims by organising a dinner reception to Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis at Cardiff City Hall on 4 February.\n\nHowever, it is with great sadness that we seem to observe a lack of consistency in the response by senior politicians and the media to these violent attacks. When a perpetrator is assumed to be Muslim and the victims are not Muslim, there is, and in our view rightly, extensive coverage of such crimes and condemnations at the highest level of government. Yet when Muslims are the victims of such crimes, the same sense of outrage is not visible. A case in point is the murder in Chapel Hill of three young Muslims, where only after the intervention of President Erdogan and sustained outrage on social media, was there any response by the establishment and little coverage in the UK.\n\nThis inconsistency from bodies that are meant to represent us all, breeds mistrust and an increased sense of being seen as the \u201cother\u201d \u2013 a key factor in the radicalisation of young people.\n\nBut these incidents have also demonstrated the danger posed by the growth in hatred. As the sister of one of those murdered in Chapel Hill highlighted, it may be inevitable that the relentless negative characterisation of Muslims within the media leads to these acts of violence.\n\nIn just the past two weeks in the UK, a mosque has been attacked in Norwich, a lady wearing a headscarf was threatened on the London underground without anyone coming to her aid, a headteacher let us know that parents were removing their children from religious education class because Islam was being taught, a school governor informed us of a growing trend of Islamophobia among children in a school \u2013 and this is over and above the consistent hate mail, verbal abuses and media excesses that seem to form part and parcel of life, as hatred against Muslims has become normalised.\n\nTo combat the evolving threat we face from such increased hatred, I believe we need both a top-down and bottom-up approach.\n\nRelated: FBI opens inquiry into North Carolina shooting deaths of Muslim students\n\nAt the national level, the government and senior politicians must be consistent in raising the profile and tackling all hate crimes equally, through a strategy fully co-ordinated with all those communities impacted. In particular, the Department for Education must act to counter anti-Muslim prejudice in schools, and all hate crimes must be recorded by the relevant authorities and appropriate protection and support provided where needed. The media\u2019s portrayal of Muslims is hugely negative and inconsistent \u2013 but only through self-reflection from journalists is this likely to change.\n\nAt the grassroots level, we must work hard to change the discourse of hate, and drive it away from the dinner table \u2013 it should no longer be seen as socially acceptable to speak about all adherents to a particular faith in such a derogatory manner. And while great interfaith work is being done up and down the country, communities still need to deepen their growing ties by working more closely together, as we have tried to do, for example, through a joint statement with the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which called for constructive dialogue.\n\nIn the end, it is only through a consistent and unified approach across all levels of society that we have a chance of combating the scourge of Islamophobia, antisemitism and hate that seeks to sow division and fear in our society, and which provides fertile ground for further violent attacks here in the UK.\n\nI believe we have the goodwill and the opportunity to ensure that divisive forces are defeated.

This is a bitter harvest.\n\nTraditionally, satire has comforted the afflicted while afflicting the comfortable. Satire punches up, against authority of all kinds, the little guy against the powerful. Great French satirists like Moli\u00e8re and Daumier always punched up, holding up the self-satisfied and hypocritical to ridicule. Ridiculing the non-privileged is almost never funny \u2014 it\u2019s just mean.\n\nBy punching downward, by attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority with crude, vulgar drawings closer to graffiti than cartoons, Charlie wandered into the realm of hate speech, which in France is only illegal if it directly incites violence.

Look closely at the rhetorical trick in his argument. First, take a general rule of good manners (don\u2019t make fun of the genuinely afflicted, especially when they are afflicted through no fault of their own). Then broaden it to any supposedly \u201cpowerless, disenfranchised minority,\u201d including ones that are defined by a belief system \u2014 which, like other belief systems, may well deserve criticism (regardless of how powerful its adherents might be, and especially because even \u201cpowerless\u201d belief systems often exercise a lot of potentially harmful power over some, such as their women and children). And then deploy this to deligitimize criticism of one of the most important and powerful belief systems on the planet, because in Hebdo\u2019s home country that belief system attracts a mere 7.5% or so of the population.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, according to Trudeau himself, this part of the population is far from innocuous. After all, he says that \u201cmany Muslims throughout France\u201d are now \u201cmak[ing] common cause with [presumably Islam\u2019s] most violent outliers.\u201d Sounds like those outliers, in Trudeau\u2019s view, really aren\u2019t such outliers within French Islam after all, if a few cartoons can turn \u201cmany Muslims\u201d into the supposed outliers\u2019 allies. Likewise, Trudeau characterizes the cartoons as \u201cdirectly incit[ing] violence,\u201d in the form of people getting murderously upset at blasphemy. Oddly, adherents of many other religions don\u2019t seem to react to blasphemy the same way. Might it be that there is some \u201cauthority\u201d here, even if in part the authority of the mob, that should indeed be subjected to some \u201cafflicting\u201d and (metaphorical) \u201cpunch[ing]\u201d?\n\nAnd then of course there is the casual \u201chate speech\u201d label, as usual used without much concrete explanation of what exactly it covers. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into that sentence and the following one, but it sounds like Trudeau would actually have applauded prosecution of the cartoonists; after all, he says the cartoons \u201cwandered into the realm of hate speech,\u201d such speech is illegal in France \u201cif it directly incites violence,\u201d and the speech \u201cdid exactly that.\u201d\n\nMight it have been helpful to explain, if only briefly, just what criticisms of Islam (or of other religions) should be seen as criminal \u2014 or even immoral \u2014 \u201chate speech\u201d? Any criticisms that someone can label \u201cpunching down\u201d? Any that are seen as blasphemous by people who are willing to respond with murder? Any that are \u201ccrude\u201d or \u201cvulgar\u201d in their words, or perhaps in their artistic style, which is too much like \u201cgraffiti\u201d rather than \u201ccartoons\u201d?\n\nEarlier in the speech, indeed, Trudeau condemned not just the Charlie Hebdo cartoons but also the Danish Mohammed cartoons, which, as I\u2019ve tried to explain in detail, are largely quite tame under any secular standard. Trudeau nonetheless condemns them because,\n\nAs you know, the Muhammad cartoon controversy began eight years ago in Denmark, as a protest against \u201cself-censorship,\u201d one editor\u2019s call to arms against what she felt was a suffocating political correctness. The idea behind the original drawings was not to entertain or to enlighten or to challenge authority \u2014 her charge to the cartoonists was specifically to provoke, and in that they were exceedingly successful. Not only was one cartoonist gunned down, but riots erupted around the world, resulting in the deaths of scores. No one could say toward what positive social end, yet free speech absolutists were unchastened. Using judgment and common sense in expressing oneself were denounced as antithetical to freedom of speech.\n\nPerhaps then he is condemning any cartoons that are intended \u201cto provoke,\u201d and that don\u2019t use \u201cjudgment and common sense\u201d (presumably because the authors and editors dare to criticize a group that contains some would-be killers). It seems to be no defense in Trudeau\u2019s eyes that the cartoons \u201cchallenge authority\u201d by challenging certain important strands within an influential world religion, by challenging a climate of fear, by challenging what some see as \u201ca suffocating political correctness,\u201d or indeed by challenging the cultural mores of the Danish equivalents of Garry Trudeau. Either he is likewise viewing the Danish cartoons as a form of \u201chate speech,\u201d which just shows how broad his notion of \u201chate speech\u201d is. Or, if he is not viewing them as \u201chate speech,\u201d then it follows that Hebdo\u2019s supposedly \u201cwander[ing] into the realm of hate speech\u201d is thus largely beside the point, since cartoons that mock or criticize Islam (especially radical Islam) shouldn\u2019t be published even when they aren\u2019t \u201chate speech.\u201d\n\nMany of the powerful throughout the world are very happy to punch down against cartoonists, and not just against cartoonists who draw Mohammed or who criticize Islam (see, e.g., the recent convictions of cartoonists in Turkey). I would have thought that one of the most prominent and (at least in the distant past) iconoclastic cartoonists in the world, receiving an award for his lifetime achievement as a cartoonist, would have explained in a bit more detail just which sorts of ideologies should now be immunized from ridicule, and which sort of cartoons should indeed be criminalized or at least condemned by the cartooning elites.\n\nEugene Volokh teaches free speech law, religious freedom law, church-state relations law, a First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic, and tort law, at UCLA School of Law, where he has also often taught copyright law, criminal law, and a seminar on firearms regulation policy."], "summary": ["Some thoughts on Doonesbury author Garry Trudeau's criticism of Charlie Hebdo."]}, {"title": ["The Education of \u2018Jihadi John\u2019"], "text": ["LONDON \u2014 LAST week, the man called \u201cJihadi John\u201d by the world\u2019s media was unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Muslim and naturalized British citizen from London. Not only that, but the Islamic State\u2019s most notorious Western recruit was identified as a graduate in computer science from the University of Westminster.\n\nMany were shocked that the apparent executioner in videos made by the Islamic State, or ISIS, was an educated, middle-class metropolitan. In fact, academic institutions in Britain have been infiltrated for years by dangerous theocratic fantasists. I should know: I was one of them.\n\nThe University of Westminster is well known for being a hotbed of extremist activity. The university\u2019s Islamic Society is heavily influenced, sometimes controlled, by the radical Islamist group Hizb-ut-Tahrir and regularly gives a platform to preachers of hate. On the very day of the Emwazi revelation, the university was to host a lecture by Haitham al-Haddad \u2014 a man accused of espousing homophobia, advocating female genital mutilation and professing that Jewish people are descended from apes and pigs. The event was suspended not by the university authorities, but by the Islamic Society, which pulled it only because of security concerns.\n\nIslamist \u201centryism\u201d \u2014 the term originally described tactics adopted by Leon Trotsky to take over a rival Communist organization in France in the early 1930s \u2014 continues to be a problem within British universities and schools. Twenty years ago, I played my part as an Islamist entryist at college.\n\nI was born and raised in Essex, just outside London, to a financially comfortable, well-educated Pakistani family. But I came of age as the genocide against Bosnian Muslims unfolded on the other side of Europe. That horror, coupled with the violence of white racists I experienced at home, led to my becoming disconnected from mainstream society.\n\nI had a mind inquiring enough to question world events, as well as the passion fostered by my background to care, but I lacked the emotional maturity to process these things. That made me ripe for Islamist recruitment. Into this ferment came my recruiter, himself straight out of a London medical college.\n\nHe belonged to Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which is Arabic for the party of liberation. An international revolutionary Islamist group founded in 1953, it was the first movement to popularize resurrecting a caliphate with a version of Shariah law. Unlike Al Qaeda, Hizb-ut-Tahrir argues for military coups, not terrorism, to achieve power.\n\nThe recruiters are adept at manipulating world events to present what I call the \u201cIslamist narrative\u201d \u2014 that the world is at war with Islam, and only a caliphate will protect Muslims from the crusaders. I was seduced by the ideology and drawn to its alternative subculture.\n\nBy age 16, I had adopted Hizb-ut-Tahrir\u2019s ideas wholeheartedly. I was asked to enroll at Newham College, a state-supported continuing education institution in east London, with the aim of gaining prominence on campus and recruiting other students to the cause. Once elected as president of the student union, I exploited the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the college, registering supporters to vote for me and consolidating our control.\n\nThe poisonous atmosphere that my supporters and I created at Newham College grew so dangerous that in 1995 my self-appointed bodyguard stabbed to death a non-Muslim student on campus, to cries of \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d The killer, Saeed Nur, was convicted of murder.\n\nI was rightly expelled from the college, though my activism did not end there. I worked first in Pakistan and then in Egypt to recruit young military officers to Hizb-ut-Tahrir\u2019s revolutionary agenda. In 2001, I was arrested by President Hosni Mubarak\u2019s secret police. During four years in a Cairo prison, I gradually reconsidered the ideology of Islam, and eventually abandoned it. On my release, I took up the human rights and counter-extremism work that occupies me now.\n\nThe Islamic Society at the University of Westminster, like others at universities across Britain, is still targeted by entryist radicals. While such institutions must guard free speech, they should also be vigilant to ensure that speakers are not given unchallenged platforms to promote their toxic message to a vulnerable audience.\n\nThese speakers claim to preach Islam, but they peddle a highly politicized, often violent strain of my faith. It is easier than one might think for bright, capable people like Mr. Emwazi to fall for the myopic worldview of the preachers of hate. Young people from relatively prosperous, educated backgrounds have long been overrepresented in jihadist causes.\n\nJust last month, Britain was thrown into consternation to learn that three young women, teenagers from the Bethnal Green Academy, had slipped out of the country to join the Islamic State. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum were all, according to their parents and peers, straight-A students.\n\nChallenging the notion of statehood, democratic theory and Middle Eastern power politics certainly takes a degree of intellectual sophistication, but it does not make an idealistic young person less vulnerable to exploitation by skilled recruiters. Regardless of good grades, they may suffer from a crisis of identity or grievances that radicalizers can prey on.\n\nThe desire to impose any religion on society is an inherently repugnant idea, but it is not so among many British Muslims. For decades, we\u2019ve allowed Islamist ideologues to work unfettered across our communities, to the extent that Islamism has become the default form of political expression for many young Muslims in Britain and across Europe.\n\nThe leap from being an ordinary British teenager to joining the Islamic State is huge. But it is a much smaller step for someone raised in a climate in which dreams of resurrecting a caliphate and enforcing a distorted form of Islam are normalized. Until we confront this seeming legitimacy of Islamist discourse at the grass roots, we will not stop the scourge of radicalization.\n\nMaajid Nawaz, the chairman of the think tank Quilliam, is the author of \u201cRadical: My Journey Out of Islamist Extremism.\u201d\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on March 3, 2015, on page A29 of the New York edition with the headline: The Education of \u2018Jihadi John\u2019.

In the palatial building, formerly the governor\u2019s mansion, they prepared statements for a press conference planned for Tuesday and also made plans to secure the local mosques from potential attacks.\n\nBacklash \u201cis a concern of any community\u201d, said Ayaz Aslam, outreach program director at the Muslim Community Center of Union County, who also attended the meeting. \u201cThis happened in our backyard so we\u2019re just concerned.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalised US citizen who was born in Afghanistan, has left many Muslims fearing the prospect of a backlash against the community. Many fear an increase in the already soaring number of hate crimes against Muslims, as well as more anti-Muslim sentiment from the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to Abdellah, Elizabeth has been largely immune to the hate crimes experienced by Muslims across the country. They did not experience an uptick following the World Trade Center attacks of 1993 or 2001, he said.\n\nSheikh and Abdellah attribute this to the diversity in Elizabeth, where black and Hispanic people make up 80% of the population. Abdellah said there is a large Muslim community among them. But neither cite a sizable Afghan community in Elizabeth and neither knew before the bombing that Rahami was Afghan. Up to 1,000 people may pray at Dar ul-Islam during Ramadan, he said, while 200-300 people attend Friday prayers regularly. Sheikh cited similar numbers for the Muslim Community Center.\n\nHowever, the fried chicken restaurant owned by Rahami\u2019s family in Elizabeth was not immune to a flurry of hateful messages on Yelp after its address was publicized on various news outlets. \u201cAll I know is you camel jockeys need to go back home,\u201d wrote one Yelp user. \u201cIf this family is supporting the terrorist with money, lodging, help, love or any other kind of support \u2026 then there\u2019s nothing wrong with blowing this place up after it\u2019s closed,\u201d said another.\n\nOn the political stage, Trump sought to use the bombing to justify \u201cextreme vetting\u201d on new immigrants that considers \u201cideology\u201d, a spin on his previous pledge to ban all Muslims from immigrating to the United States. Donald Trump Jr went as far as comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles, sparking outrage online.\n\nThis image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN\n\nIn a speech in Florida, Trump Sr also called for Rahami to be treated as an enemy combatant, meaning he would forfeit many rights afforded to citizens, but stopped short of saying torture tactics should be reinstated as he has done in the past.\n\nThe hysteria following the arrest of Muslims in relation to terrorist activities places Islamic organizations in a difficult position.\n\nOrganizations like the Council of American-Islamic Relations issue swift messages of condemnation that vehemently affirm that actors such as Rahami are not representative of the broader Muslim community.\n\n\u201cIn general when we hear of attacks like this, our hearts go out to all the people that are affected by it and, to be very frank, it doesn\u2019t matter to us what is the background of the person [who carried out the attack],\u201d said Omar Awad, CEO and president of the Islamic Center of Passaic County. \u201cNevertheless, when that individual turns out to be from a Muslim background, we definitely believe that these are not Islamic actions or anything that actually aligns with the Islamic teachings. It adds more complexity to our situation.\u201d\n\nAwad said it can be exhausting to have to condemn actions that in no way represent the community, but he stressed it\u2019s better to have Muslim voices then to cede that space to people such as Trump.\n\n\u201cYou see people being quoted on news outlets as experts in Islamic affairs, and these people were never elected from the Muslim community to speak on their behalf,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very exhausting to be constantly in that position to try to say that, \u2018Yes we condemn these factions,\u2019 but I think as institutions we have to, until we have a better apparatus to speak about it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Awad had a discussion with the director of homeland security for the state of New Jersey and the US attorney general to discuss ways to safeguard the community against the potential consequences of the weekend\u2019s events.\n\nA study by California State University San Bernardino found hate crimes against Muslims in 2015 were the highest they have been since 9/11, increasing by 78%.\n\nBased on available data for 2016, the study found that hate crimes against Muslims in New York City have doubled since last year. The city has seen an uptick in attacks against Muslims in recent weeks, which was most starkly felt in August, when an imam and his friend were both shot in the back of the head in Queens, while walking home from midday prayers.\n\nResearchers at California State University found that negative statements about Muslims by politicians following terrorist attacks was one of the driving factors for increased hate crimes. They compared former president George W Bush\u2019s visit to a mosque following 9/11 to proclaim \u201cIslam is peace\u201d, with Trump\u2019s speech to ban all Muslims from entering the US following attacks in San Bernardino. The former was followed by a range of 46% to 66% decline in hate crimes against Muslims, while the latter was followed by an increase of 87.5%.\n\nMuslims in New Jersey came into the spotlight when Trump claimed last year that Muslims in Jersey City celebrated when the Twin Towers fell on 9/11. His claims were widely discredited, including by Jersey City\u2019s mayor.\n\n\u201cThese comments are extremely divisive to our nation,\u201d Awad said. \u201cEvents like these add to the complexity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he said it, I thought he was crazy,\u201d said Muryd Williams, 24, who performs the call to prayer at Dar ul-Islam mosque. \u201cHave you been on Manhattan island by the ferries and looked over at Jersey City? How can you see anybody from over there?\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what anybody says. If Trump says that we\u2019re the best people he ever met or we\u2019re the worst people he ever met,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople are gonna hate us regardless.\u201d"], "summary": ["Local leaders in Elizabeth, New Jersey, assembled to express concerns and secure mosques amid rise in violence against Muslims: \u2018People will hate us regardless\u2019"]}, {"title": ["Mocking Muhammad is not hate speech"], "text": ["To stop Islamist violence over perceived insults to Muhammad, I argued in a FoxNews.com op-ed Friday, editors and producers daily should display cartoons of Muhammad \u201cuntil the Islamists get used to the fact that we turn sacred cows into hamburger.\u201d\n\nThis appeal prompted a solemn reply from Sheila Musaji of The American Muslim website, who deemed it \u201cirresponsible and beyond the pale.\u201d Why so? Because, as she puts it, \u201cThe solution to escalating violence and hate speech is not more hate speech.\u201d\n\nThat sounds sensible enough. But does mocking Muhammad, burning a Koran, or calling Islam a cult constitute hate speech? And what about the respectful representations of Muhammad in the buildings of the U.S. Supreme Court or the New York State Supreme Court? Even they caused upset and rioting.\n\nHate speech, legal authorities agree, involves words directed against a category of persons. Here\u2019s a typical definition, from USLegal.com: \u201cincitement to hatred primarily against a group of persons defined in terms of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and the like.\u201d\n\nAttacking the sanctities of a religion, I submit, is quite unlike targeting the faithful of that religion. The former is protected speech, part of the give and take of the market place of ideas, not all of which are pretty. Freedom of speech means the freedom to insult and be obnoxious. So long as it does not include incitement or information that urges criminal action, nastiness is an essential part of our heritage.\n\nOn a personal note, I have had to learn to live with torrents of vulgar venom, in speech and in pictures alike, from those who disagree with me; you don\u2019t hear me whining about it. More broadly, Catholics, Jews, Mormons, and other faith communities in the West have learned since the Enlightenment to endure vicious lacerations on their symbols and doctrines.\n\nIf proof be needed, recall Monty Python\u2019s \"Life of Brian,\" Terrence McNally\u2019s \"Corpus Christi,\" Andres Serrano\u2019s \"Piss Christi,\" and Chris Ofili\u2019s \"The Holy Virgin Mary.\" Or, the torrent of antisemitic cartoons spewing from Muslims.\n\nFor an over-the-top recent example, The Onion humor website published a cartoon under the heading, \u201cNo One Murdered Because of This Image.\u201d It shows Moses, Jesus, Ganesha, and Buddha in the clouds, engaged in what the caption delicately understates as \u201ca lascivious sex act of considerable depravity.\u201d As the Onion mock-reportingly but accurately goes on, \u201cThough some members of the Jewish, Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist faiths were reportedly offended by the image, sources confirmed that upon seeing it, they simply shook their heads, rolled their eyes, and continued on with their day.\u201d\n\nI asked for the cartoons to be published again and again to establish that Islamists must not chip away at the freedom to mock and insult by hiding behind bogus claims of incitement. Name an instance, Ms Musaji, when biting remarks about Muhammad, the Koran, or Islam have led to riots and murders by non-Muslims against Muslims?\n\nI can think of not a single one.\n\nWhen attacks on Muslims take place, they occur in response to terrorism by Muslims; that\u2019s no excuse, to be sure, but it does indicate that violence against Muslims has no connection with lampooning Muhammad or desecrating Korans. Muslims need to grow thick skins like everyone else; that\u2019s one of the by-products of globalization. The insulation of old is gone for good.\n\nTo make matters worse, Islamists tell us Be Careful with Muhammad! and threaten those with the temerity to discuss, draw, or even pretend to draw the prophet of Islam, even as they freely disparage and insult other religions. I can cite many examples of actors, satirists, artists, cartoonists, writers, editors, publishers, ombudsmen, and others openly admitting their intimidation about discussing Islamic topics, a problem even Ms Musaji herself has acknowledged.\n\nTo cool the temperature, Muslims can take two steps: end terrorism and stop the rioting over cartoons and novels. That will cause the antagonism toward Islam built up over the past decade to subside. At that point, I will happily retract my appeal to editors and producers to flaunt offensive cartoons of Muhammad.\n\nDaniel Pipes is president of the Middle East Forum."], "summary": ["Does mocking Muhammad, burning a Koran, or calling Islam a cult constitute hate speech?"]}, {"title": ["Islam incompatible: One Nation senator"], "text": ["One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts says he agrees with Pauline Hanson that Islam does not fit with Australia's way of life and that Muslim immigration should be halted.\n\nSenator Roberts said Islam was a political ideology , a way of life, a legal system that was incompatible with Australia's secular system and was not a religion of peace.\n\n\"We have Muslims ... who are members of our party.

But Kazim, a 40-year-old journalist with Spiegel Online, is treated to rollicking laughter and applause instead. This, after all, is Hate Poetry night in Berlin, an opportunity for a troupe of German journalists, all of whom have vaguely Muslim-sounding names, to read out some of the more creatively despicable messages clogging up their inboxes.\n\nDisturbingly, each has plenty to choose from, and the fountain of hatred flows late into the evening, with insults like these: \u201cI have nothing against Muslims as long as the only place they are staying is at the local cemetery\u201d and \u201cSod off you tosser. I piss on your Muslim flag. People are losing their heads, and you worry about whether your child-fucking prophet can be banned?\u201d\n\nThe journalists are also subjected to more common insults, like being called \u201cstealth jihadists\u201d and \u201cundercover agents for the Islamisation of Europe\u201d. Many are frequently told they should leave the country. \u201cJust because you\u2019re not wearing a headscarf,\u201d read one, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not fanatical.\u201d Often, as with Kazim, the son of Indian-Pakistani immigrants to Germany, the recipients aren\u2019t even Muslim.\n\nRather than suffer such indignities in silence, the writers banded together to form a kind of slam-poetry series, where the most imaginative and eloquently abhorrent diatribes are read out as mesmerising, high-concept theatre. At the event I\u2019m at, the stage is decorated with objects of oriental and German kitsch \u2013 a garish melange paying homage to the heritages of the performers. There are Turkish, Kurdish and German flags, posters of Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan, images of Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party leader Abdullah \u00d6calan, a photo of Arsenal FC\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil, a Charlie Hebdo cover, prayer rugs and strands of garlic. Many of the journalists are dressed up, too, with one wearing a keffiyeh and another an Indian sherwani.\n\nThe show is presented as a competition, with a hostess awarding prizes in such categories as \u201cDear Mr Asshole and Dear Ms Cunt\u201d or \u201cSubscription Cancellation\u201d. The prizes include a yellow safety vest adorned with the words \u201cSharia Police\u201d and a mosque-shaped alarm clock. The most outrageous letters are greeted with showers of confetti and an atmosphere of political incorrectness prevails, with frequent off-colour jokes about everything from Hitler to circumcision. \u201cPeople often tell us we have theatrical talent,\u201d says Mely Kiyak, a 38-year-old Kurdish-German columnist for Die Zeit Online. \u201cThe fact is that these letters are so full of rage and drama, they practically stage themselves.\u201d\n\nGermany is home to around 4 million Muslims, less than 6% of the population, but unease about Islam appears to be growing in the country. In a November survey by pollster Emnid, 61% of Germans said Islam doesn\u2019t fit in the western world, while 40% said the presence of Muslims made them feel like foreigners in their own country. Although Germany lacks the kind of strong, overtly anti-Muslim political party that many of its neighbours have, such statistics indicate that Islamophobia is more mainstream than it is marginal. The widely publicised protests throughout the winter in Dresden by Pegida (which in English stands for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West) have underscored that point.\n\nIn fact, Hate Poetry travelled to Dresden for a performance in December specifically to counter the now-diminishing Pegida marches. So many Dresdeners wanted to attend that chairs had to be taken out in order to pack them in. \u201cWhen 15,000 people are taking to the streets in German cities to protest against minority religions, something is seriously, seriously wrong,\u201d says Yassin Musharbash, 39, a journalist with Die Zeit whose father is Jordanian. \u201cThis just cannot be happening.\u201d\n\nKiyak describes the emails as a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d by their authors \u201cto get noticed, because they have the feeling that journalists with immigrant backgrounds are spreading and are somehow trying to take away something that belongs to them\u201d. Explaining the selection criteria for letters to be read on stage, she says it\u2019s about \u201cdigging up the truffles among the contempt\u201d. One, received by Mohamed Amjahid, a 27-year-old Moroccan writer with Der Tagesspiegel, reads: \u201cYou may be able to write well, but you still have to leave Germany.\u201d Another says: \u201cI remain convinced that Mohammedans are dangerous and a threat to democracy. That\u2019s why I propose a referendum to make all Muslims leave.\u201d\n\nAs Musharbash says: \u201cWe know they are terrible, but we don\u2019t want to feel like victims or waste an evening crying over them.\u201d Instead, Hate Poetry relies on the group therapy offered by comedy and a public airing. \u201cWe shoot the shit back into circulation,\u201d he says.

He says he finds the experience of appearing on stage a bit like visiting a hamam. \u201cYou get rid of all the shit. After that, you feel clean.

After a Wagnerian-length show of over four hours, the performance closes with Musharbash granting absolution to the audience. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel bad,\u201d he tells them. \u201cTonight, it was completely fine to laugh about racism.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The next Hate Poetry is at Theaterlabor in Bielefeld, Germany, on 7 March."], "summary": ["What do you do if your inbox is clogged up with anti-Muslim hate mail?

He received a five-and-a-half-year jail sentence on Tuesday for encouraging support for the Islamic State.\n\nAuthorities in London charged the extremist Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary with \"inviting support\" for the Islamic State, which could lead to his trial and imprisonment. Investigators said that Choudary was encouraging people to back the jihadists through a number of lectures that were later published online.\n\nAs my colleague Karla Adam reports, the move is a high-profile test case for new counter-extremism initiatives launched by British Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\n[Britain\u2019s new anti-terror policy tested by move against prominent preacher]\n\nIn Britain, Choudary is a known entity who infuriates many, including the vast majority of the country's Muslims, as Media Matters lays out:\n\nThe advocacy group Hope Not Hate has described Choudary as \"the single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history,\" saying he has \"facilitated or encouraged\" many Muslims to join the anti-Assad militants in Syria. Muslim groups in the United Kingdom have also denounced Choudary. The Muslim Council of Britain called him \"a self-serving publicity seeker,\" and the Islamic Society of Britain said Choudary \"has no legitimacy in the Muslim community.\"\n\nThe description of Choudary as \"a self-serving publicity seeker\" is particularly apt. He unabashedly espouses radical fundamentalist views and has been repeatedly given a platform by Western journalists to voice them.\n\nAnjem Choudary has been waving a giant \"Arrest Me\" flag for the past decade and a half and has finally been put out of his misery.\n\n\u2014 Murtaza Hussain (@MazMHussain) August 5, 2015\n\nThe biggest megaphone he received in the United States was arguably on Fox News, as a repeat guest of right-wing ideologue Sean Hannity. His first appearance on Hannity's show was last August, shortly after the Islamic State beheaded American journalist James Foley.\n\nThe conversation was predictably full of shouting, name-calling and dogmatic bluster. Choudary was a perfect foil for Hannity, who got to play the tough-talking, truth-telling, freedom-loving hero to Choudary's terror-worshiping, women-stoning villain.\n\nYet, for all the insults hurled, Choudary happily returned in January, after the grisly Paris terror attacks. His enlightening dialogue with Hannity went along the same lines. \"I still think you're an evil SOB,\" Hannity concluded.\n\nBut the \"evil SOB\" returned a few months later, this time as a counterpoint to Pamela Geller, the well-known American Islamophobe who styles herself as a free-speech advocate. The conversation was framed around the subtle question of whether Choudary believed Geller ought to die.\n\nTwo figures on the radical fringe got to grandstand, spout their ideological talking points, while Hannity scowled, looked grim and then eventually launched into a diatribe against Islam as a religion. \"You are evil and pathetic,\" Hannity told the guest he had now put on television three times.\n\nChoudary's views are reprehensible and the calm with which he articulates awful things is unnerving. But he's exactly the sort of interlocutor Hannity wants -- a provocative, fundamentalist bigot whom Hannity can present to viewers as the face of evil Islam.\n\nThe space given to Choudary also comes in stark contrast to Hannity and his network's almost immediate intolerance for some Muslims who attempt to respond to insulting, simplistic lines of questioning with nuance and reason.\n\nChoudary, meanwhile, appears to love the attention. A few days ago, he tweeted out the link to a recent debate with Zuhdi Jasser, another frequent Fox News guest, and Robert Spencer, a fellow traveler with Geller. It's as if they all were meant for each other.\n\nThe misguided debate over the Islam of the Islamic State"], "summary": ["Anjem Choudary appeared multiple times on the Fox News anchor's show."]}, {"title": ["For American Muslims, a year of living dangerously"], "text": ["Today's guest blogger is Farhana Khera, the Executive Director of Muslim Advocates, a national legal advocacy and educational organization.\n\nAs this weekend's arson at a Portland, Oregon mosque perfectly illustrates, 2010 has been one of the most difficult and fearful years on record for many American Muslims, surpassing even those dark days following the tragedy of 9-11. This was the year that it became acceptable in America to openly state your hatred of Muslims and, in some cases, act on it.\n\nPut simply, some fail to grasp the motto created at our nation's founding--e pluribus unum--\"out of many, one\" -- and that our nation's strength is derived from its diversity. As Americans, we are obliged to demand that our elected officials act to stem this rising tide of hate and defend our nation's founding values.\n\nThis year, Americans witnessed a perfect convergence of events for such demagoguery: ignorance, fear-mongering, and an election cycle. In addition to the hate-crime in Portland, arson, intimidation and lawsuits in a Tennessee mosque's construction, a threatened mass Qur'an burning in Florida, and an incoherent, unnecessary state law passed by Oklahomans all illustrate how irrational the fear of American Muslims has become. Anti-Muslim hatred is now a well-funded, politically useful and corrosive social malady in America.\n\nIn Tennessee, a Muslim community whose congregation has never exhibited any unlawful behavior was effectively told \"go back where you came from...\", first by protesters shouting anti-Muslim slurs, then by thugs who set fire to construction equipment, and finally, by opponents who tried to stop the new mosque in court. They failed.\n\nIt should come as no surprise to some that members of this community report that the protests have abated since the November elections, though tensions remain. Unfortunately, the hostile tone set by those months has left many in what was once a quiet community resigned to always look over their shoulder and avoid the public eye. Is this how we create community in America?\n\nIn Florida, pure, unadulterated religious bigotry drove one self-anointed Christian pastor to threaten to burn multiple copies of the Qur'an, while encouraging Americans to mail him more copies for his bonfire. His defiant plan brought condemnations from U.S. officials, including General David Petraeus, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It also unified many Christian, Muslim and Jewish faith leaders in their opposition to the burning.\n\nBut the damage was done, and copycats began burning Qur'ans in places like Texas, Illinois and Michigan. The charred pages of each sacred book spoke clearly to American Muslims: \"You are not welcome here.\"\n\nMost recently, 70% of voters in Oklahoma decided to banish Shariah law even though there has never been a case of Shariah law--or any other religious doctrine--trumping local laws. The 'Supremacy Clause' in the U.S. Constitution has always made it clear that the Constitution takes precedent to any religion's laws. The Oklahoma shariah ban--which was suspended on November 29 by a federal judge --did succeed in doing one thing: it further demonized the state's tiny minority of Muslims. The attempted law also illustrates a divisive and self-serving opportunism that some--mostly politicians--have decided to pursue.\n\nSuch hateful acts and words have real-life consequences. Muslim advocates around the country reported that their communities are seeing an alarming spike in harassment of mosque congregants, anti-Muslim graffiti, and, in one case, in New York City, a near-fatal attack on a Bangladeshi-American taxi driver.\n\nIf history is any guide, such bigotry, especially when led by political leaders, will prove to have disastrous consequences for us as a nation.\n\nWhile American Muslims are exhausted from this year of hate and ignorance, they can look to a few positive signs, such as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's October announcement that the Justice Department was filing a legal brief in the Tennessee mosque construction case, siding with the Muslim community and defending religious freedom.\n\nNow, the State Attorneys General need to follow the federal example. It was appalling that the State of Oklahoma's top law officer remained silent about the anti-Shariah law after its passage. With other states threatening to pass similar laws, Americans of all faiths need to let their elected officials know that we will not let hate and bigotry destroy our nation.\n\nThe content of this blog reflects the views of its author and does not necessarily reflect the views of either Eboo Patel or the Interfaith Youth Core.\n\nBy Eboo Patel | December 2, 2010; 9:24 AM ET | Category: Morality , Personal Religion , Religion & Leadership , Religion & Politics , Religious Conflict Save & Share: Previous: What motivated Portland 'Christmas tree bomber'? | Next: Searching for the American DREAM\n\nBurning mosques/other places of worship?

Self restraint is a virtue being practiced every day by Americans as we see people tryingto kill us any time we let down our guard.\n\nSunnis Muslims blow up Shiite Mosques. Shiites reciprocate. Both Sunnis and Shiites persecute Christians, Hindus, Bhudists and atheists.\n\nMosques are safer in the US than in the Middle East, but Mr. Patel's hatred toward the US causes him to overlook the failings of others and focus solely on US imperfections.\n\nNo, Mr. Patel, Americans don't \"hate\" Muslims.\n\nMuslims trying to kill thousnds of Americans every year are causing Americans to fear Muslims.\n\nConvincing Muslim terrorists to wear uniforms like the US military so we can tell peaceful Muslims from enemy Muslisms would do more to protect peaceful Muslims than any other single measure, but the terrorist Muslims prefer to hide until they strike. Blame your fellow Muslims for the distrust that causes.\n\nThe stated purpose of some Muslims to bring Sharia law to the US is causing people to take legal action to prevent that from happening.

They are almost uniformly ruled by dictators. No freedom. Nor rights. Many Moslems believe they have the right to murder their political opponents including their women and children. Look at what they do to people praying in church and in religious processions. As practiced the Moslem religion has no moral scruples. Many moslems seek to impose sharia law in the USA. This is an abomination. It is a de facto call for the overthrow of the USA government and spits in the face of loyal Americans.\n\nIn WWII many Moslems favored the Nazis and admired their treatment of Jews. Today moslems are seeking the final solution to their Jewish problem. Believe it or not there are quite a few Moslems who changed their last name to Hitler. I had to work with one. Moslems teach their children to hate jews. They cultivate this hatred in kindergartners. The fact that moslems admire one of the most evil men who ever lived and desire the murder of millions is sickening. It illuminates the evil nature of their religion.\n\nNow look at how mosques have been used as recruitment centers for terrorists and to raise money to support terrorist. We are at war and the Moslems in this country are providing aid and comfort to our enemies. We hardly every hear of Moslems standing up to the Moslem terrorists and fighting against them.\n\nIt light of these facts it is amazing how well Moslems have been treated in the USA and they have a lot of gaul to complain.\n\nPosted by: ConradCA | December 2, 2010 12:17 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nEboo, playing the victim is not going to work.

These laws and the treatment of the non-muslims in Islamic countries is the evidence that Muslims implement the commands of Allah towards the non-muslims?

The following day, some 25 Muslim and Christian leaders gathered in the same town to denounce the group's actions. (Griff Witte,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\nLUTON, England -- It\u2019s a video that depicts just the sort of civilizational clash that extremists everywhere crave: Christians walking down a central shopping street in Britain. Muslim storekeepers and passerby hurling verbal abuse. A push. More abuse from both sides. And finally, police intervening to keep the warring clans apart.\n\nThe video, a slick propaganda job by the virulently anti-Muslim group Britain First, became a viral hit when the organization posted it to its Facebook page, racking up millions of views.\n\n[In supposed no-go zone, British Muslims, Christians say no to fanatics]\n\nBut there was more to the story than what the video showed.\n\nThe video was filmed on Jan. 23 in the multicultural British town of Luton, 30 miles north of London. The town, a former industrial powerhouse that is today known for its budget-flight-focused airport, has become a magnet for both Islamist and Islamophobic extremists. It\u2019s often the canvas upon which hate groups unfurl their provocative displays.\n\nAnd so it was when Britain First came to town for the fourth time in two years for what it termed a \u201cChristian Patrol.\u201d\n\nThe group -- a far-right rival of the homegrown English Defense League -- specializes in anti-Muslim street theater, while dressing itself in the garb of a devoutly Christian organization. Members wear dark green paramilitary-style uniforms, and march with oversized crosses through Muslim-majority areas, or even through mosques.\n\nAlthough the demonstrations are small, the group has won \u201chuge support on social media and has created a climate of fear amongst Muslim communities,\u201d according to the anti-extremist organization Hope not Hate.\n\nIn the video, about 20 Britain First members set out to walk through Luton\u2019s Bury Park, the heart of the town\u2019s South Asian community.\n\n\u201cThis is a British town, and we are proud to be British,\u201d says Jayda Fransen, one of the group\u2019s leaders, as they begin their march through a low-slung commercial area marked by halal butchers, hijab shops and travel agencies specializing in flights to Pakistan.\n\nThe scenes are overlaid with ominous, martial music, and it doesn\u2019t take long for the inevitable fireworks to erupt.\n\n\u201cThis is our country!\u201d a South Asian shopkeeper yells at the passing band of activists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Christian country!\u201d Fransen shoots back.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re jealous that we\u2019re taking over,\u201d the shopkeeper replies as another man tries to restrain him.\n\nMore yelling ensues. Residents curse the Britain First demonstrators, threaten them and, at one point, even shove them. A demonstrator calls out for Muslims \u201cto reject the false prophet, Mohammed.\u201d The police ultimately have to step in to keep the situation from escalating.\n\nAt the end, Fransen reports that her group has been subjected to \u201can enormous amount of hostility from the local Muslims.\u201d\n\nBut missing from the video is what residents say was the provocation and harassment by the Britain First demonstrators before locals responded. One woman, dressed in a black hijab, said she and her children were surrounded by protesters who shouted at her, demanding to know why she wore the veil.\n\nAlso missing was the fact that 14 Christian leaders in Luton had written to Britain First telling the group to stay away.\n\n\u201cAs Christians we are committed to share our faith, but we\u2019re also called to love our neighbor, and live at peace with them,\u201d the church leaders wrote. \u201cBritain First seems to have a very different approach.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s no mention in the video of what happened the day after Britain First\u2019s demonstration: Some 25 Muslim and Christian leaders gathered in the center of Bury Park to denounce Britain First\u2019s actions, and to distribute flowers. They were welcomed warmly, and thanked for coming.\n\nThe Christians also handed out a statement expressing \u201cdeep regret\u201d for what had happened the previous day.\n\n\u201cToday we want to stand with you as friends, neighbors and fellow Lutonians,\u201d said Peter Adams, one of the church leaders, as he read from the statement. \u201cWe want to stand together with you in opposing all extremism that seeks to divide us.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) criticized the move.\n\n\u201cLook at today \u2014 he gave a speech at a mosque,\u201d Rubio said Wednesday. \u201cOh, you know, basically implying that America is discriminating against Muslims. Of course, there\u2019s going to be discrimination in America of every kind. But the bigger issue is radical Islam. And by the way, radical Islam poses a threat to Muslims themselves.\u201d\n\nThat reply became a question at the Republican debate on Saturday. \u201cYou said of President Obama, quote, \u2018He\u2019s always pitting people against each other,\u2019 \u201d ABC moderator David Muir asked, noting that President George W.

But it\u2019s clear that 1) most Americans think that discrimination against Muslims exists and 2) Republicans are less likely to think that.\n\nLast December, following Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he wanted to bar Muslims from entering the United States, The Post and ABC News asked Americans whether or not they thought Muslims in the United States experienced discrimination based on their religion. Seventy-three percent of Americans did, with 59 percent saying that the discrimination was unjustified.\n\nAmong Republicans, though, more than a third thought Muslims experienced no discrimination \u2014 and a third of those who thought that they did thought it was justified. (By contrast, 83 percent of Democrats thought Muslims experienced discrimination.)\n\nLast month, Pew Research surveyed Americans to try and determine how they felt about the patriotism of American Muslims. Sixty-three percent of Republicans said that about half or more of Muslims in the country were \u201canti-American\u201d \u2014 up from 47 percent in 2002. The number of Democrats saying that remained about the same over the last 14 years.\n\nThere\u2019s a more concrete way of looking at discrimination against Muslims. The FBI keeps records on hate crimes in the United States, the most recent year of data being 2014. In 2014, there were 1,140 victims of hate crimes based on religion. Of that total, the majority were targeted for being Jewish. The next most commonly targeted religion? Muslims.\n\nCompared to the density of the religions in the population (as measured by Pew), both Jewish and Muslim Americans are targeted disproportionately.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that 6.1 percent of the religious hate crimes in 2014 targeted Catholics, a group that is about a fifth of the population. Rubio isolated one instance of Catholics feeling oppressed during the debate.\n\n\u201cI do believe it is important also to recognize, you want to talk about religious discrimination in America,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think Barack Obama is being sued by any Islamic groups, but he is being sued by the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are facing in this country Christian groups and groups that hold traditional values who feel and in fact are being discriminated against by the laws of this country that try to force them to vie to violate their conscience.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, 70 Catholics were targeted for hate crimes, of some 64 million Americans. That same year, 184 of America's 3 million Muslims were similarly targeted.\n\nIs this \u201cwidespread,\u201d \u201csystematic\u201d discrimination \u2014 if that was President Obama\u2019s point?

Follow him on Twitter.\n\n(CNN) -- I grew up in an interfaith home where I learned, despite what some on the far right allege today, that Islam and Christianity have much in common. My father was Muslim and born in the 1930s in what was then known as Palestine. My mother is Italian (Sicilian, to be accurate) and proudly Christian.\n\nMy family was the embodiment of the American Dream: An immigrant father and first generation mother of differing ethnicities and faiths, who did more than just co-exist: They flourished.\n\nOur mini \"melting pot\" succeeded because we focused on the commonalities between Islam and Christianity, the most obvious being that we worship the same God. How could we not? After all, we share almost identical prophets such as Moses, Abraham and Jesus.\n\nMy Muslim cousins would even celebrate Christmas with us every year - -not only to be social, but because there's a religious basis. To Muslims, Jesus is a prophet referred to in the Quran as \"The Messiah,\" born of the Virgin Mary, who was herself born of immaculate conception.\n\nGrowing up in North Jersey in the 1980s, no one expressed any issues with our heritage or faith. In fact, in third grade my teacher asked me to bring my father to school for \"show and tell\" so the students could meet an Arab Muslim man. I can only imagine if this event was replicated today, some would protest, claiming my father was there trying to spread sharia law or convert the children to Islam.\n\nDespite my upbringing in a very ethnic home, by September 11, 2001, I identified as a typical white American. I wasn't Dean Obeidallah, the Arab-American, I was just Dean. As I have joked in my stand-up act, I didn't have any Arab friends before 9/11. All my friends had names like Joey, Chandler and Monica.\n\nBut as I stood on the corner of Eighth Street and Sixth Avenue in Lower Manhattan on that fateful September morning watching in horror as the towers crumbled before my eyes, I knew all our lives would change. I just never could have predicted the trajectory my own life would take.\n\nSoon after 9/11, I found that my membership in \"The White Club\" had been revoked. I was now a minority, which, truthfully, was not something I wanted to be.\n\nI'm not saying being a white person in America is easy, but being a minority in America is a completely different kind of challenge, for the simple reason that as a minority you aren't only responsible for yourself, you are also called to answer for the sins of the worst in your minority group.\n\nIn time I began to embrace my Arab roots. I soon decided to use my comedy, whenever possible, to counter the misconceptions my fellow Americans harbored about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nNow, 10 years after 9/11, I have grown accustomed to and even enjoy my minority status. But I do have a grave concern: I have never witnessed more anti-Muslim rhetoric espoused by politicians, religious leaders and in media outlets than I do today. Not even in the days after 9/11.\n\nThere was a time in our nation's history when if you wanted to demonize a religion or race, you had to wear a white sheet over your head. Not any longer. Indeed, peddlers of hate wouldn't want to cover their face because they want people to know who they are so they can sell more books, secure more well paying speaking engagements, and appear more often on television. (I'm looking at you Fox News!)\n\nBut I'm fully confident this will pass. In fact, I have already observed encouraging signs.\n\nRecently, the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization created in 1971 to expose the activities of hate groups, listed leaders of the Muslim hate movement in the same league as The Aryan Terror Brigade, the American Nazi Party, and the Ku Klux Klan. Thankfully, this begins the marginalization of these Muslim hate groups to the fringes of American society where they justly belong.\n\nMore interfaith alliances between Muslims, Christians and Jews have been formed. In fact, American Catholic.org's national magazine features a cover story this month designed to dispel misconceptions about Islam and bring Catholics and Muslims closer together. (Some forget that right-wing Americans had alleged that Catholics and democracy could not exist together and that a Catholic candidate for president -- John F. Kennedy -- would, if elected, follow the directives of the pope, not the U.S. Constitution.)\n\nThis week, the national Jewish Daily Forward published an editorial entitled, \"Remember Who We Are,\" imploring Jewish Americans to reject the extremist voices of hate that target American Muslims and specifically called on, by name, the few Jewish people involved in the Muslim hate movement to stop.\n\nWe must stand together today as Americans, just as we did in 2001 after the attacks. We cannot allow those who promote hate, either here or abroad, to divide our nation.\n\nAs then presidential candidate John F. Kennedy cautioned America in 1960 while defending himself against anti-Catholic attacks: \"Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you -- until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart.\"\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah."], "summary": ["Dean Obeidallah grew up American in Jersey with Arab dad and Catholic mom.

I was raised Catholic, the daughter of a disabled Vietnam vet. And I appreciated the upbringing the church afforded me. At Catholic school, I learned to love God and respect people of all faiths.\n\nBut I found it difficult to accept the teachings about the Holy Trinity. So I sought out other monotheistic religions.\n\nIn college, I became agnostic. But after my roommate (a Baptist) converted to Islam, I got interested. As she learned more about it, she shared her findings with me. I appreciated the revolutionary equality the prophet Muhammad taught when he said that \u201can Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over a black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action.\u201d I saw my passion for justice reflected in the Koran\u2019s call to \u201cbe persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for God, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, God is more worthy of both.\u201d And I realized that the Islamic attitude that \u201cfor you is your religion, and for me is my religion,\u201d could save our world a whole lot of strife if we only heeded it.\n\nTo me, Islam was a peaceful faith, no matter what a handful of violent extremists said. So I chose to convert in November 2001. I began wearing a hijab and attending a mosque.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. In the weeks and months after 9/11, news outlets portrayed all Muslims as violent and intolerant. There was a 1,700 percent increase of hate crimes against American Muslims between 2000 to 2001. I experienced this intolerance firsthand. Once, a postal worker asked if my package had a bomb in it. Another time, a man in a truck threw eggs at me \u2014 I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019d been targeted because of my Islamic attire. I hated this behavior, but I tried to be understanding. My fellow countrymen and women were scared; maybe they were just lashing out. So I put up with the stares from strangers that dripped with hate. I smiled and moved on. I responded to racial slurs and shouts of \u201cGo back to your country,\u201d with \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\nWhen my mosque in Savannah, Ga., was burned down in 2003, I started to understand what real fear feels like. I felt rejected by my own people. That day, I understood the bitterness of alienation. But I was also warmed by my community\u2019s resilience. At the Friday service following the arson, as we prayed in the grass next to a charred shell of our mosque, reminded of the Koranic verse, \u201crepel [evil] by that [deed] which is better and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, the prejudice I experienced felt drove me toward a deeper understanding of Islam. It pushed me to define for myself what it means to be both fully American and fully Muslim, both for myself and for those who asked.\n\nTwelve years later, the climate of hate has only gotten worse. Extremists who call themselves Muslims continue to terrorize people of all faiths across the globe. American extremists continue to stoke the flames of fear and hate, attacking Muslims in rhetoric, in our houses of worship and even on the street.\n\nPresidential candidates speak about Muslims like me in debates, interviews and rallies as though I were a problem to be done away with. These same people want 8-year-old Muslim girls to wear ID badges. They want to put the name of a Muslim who served two tours in Iraq in a religious-based registry. They want to close down places where Muslims go to connect with God, to share in holiday celebration and organize volunteer efforts. They want to take away our American rights. Our inalienable rights.\n\nThis hate has only made it harder for me to operate as a Muslim woman. Over the past year, I have received hundreds of emails, instant messages and tweets on the website I run, saying things like, \u201cCommit mass suicide as soon as you read this. PLEASE. We need to clean up the environment. Let\u2019s start with sub-human waste.\u201d The man behind me in line growls at me. I am refused service at a coffee shop. My husband\u2019s boss calls him a terrorist in front of clients.\n\nI feel so worn down. Every time I step out of my home, I have to check the news to make sure that the Islamic State or al-Shabaab or Boko Haram haven\u2019t committed another insane act of brutality in their blind search for power. I have to make sure that Trump hasn\u2019t gone on another ignorant tirade, further normalizing Islamophobia in America in his blind search for power. If they have, I know it will not be safe for me to leave my home alone.\n\nMembers of my mosque are visibly stressed by their outraged at the Islamic State and exhausted by the atmosphere of fear and anti-Muslim sentiment. A few Fridays ago, I overheard two elderly men at the mosque talking about wanting to join the military to fight ISIS. Like these elderly Muslims, many American Muslims are sickened by terrorists and tired of being lumped in with them. They are desperate for public ways to take action and fight back with good deeds.\n\nAmericans cannot lose hope in one another. That the gravitational pull of fear and hate is growing. And the divide is getting wider. But we cannot allow political theater and power hungry thugs to use hate and fear to tear us apart. If we give in and abandon our dearly held principles for the sake of fear, extremists will have won.

The campaign, funded by the Open Society Foundation and the Proteus Fund, will focus on achieving public policy changes, educating the US public about Muslims and giving community activists a platform to battle discrimination.\n\nThe campaign aims to challenge acts of discrimination such as an incident that occurred on June 16, during a panel discussion held by the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC.\n\nDuring a discussion about the\u00c2 attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, a Muslim law student named Saba Ahmed said: \"We portray Islam and all Muslims as bad, but there's 1.8 billion followers of Islam.

You need to make sure that we are part of that and the, quote, 'moderate' Muslims that you're talking about, which are almost every Muslim living here in this country, need to be part of this discussion.\"\n\nMuslim American activists worry that rhetoric such as Gabriel's can fuel violent attacks and hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims. There are some 3.6 million Americans of Arab descent, many of whom are Christian, and an estimated six million American Muslims of varying nationalities,\u00c2 according to the Arab American Institute.\n\n\"The worse things get in the Middle East, the worse things get for Arab Americans here in the US. Every time there is something serious in the Middle East, things spike,\" Samer Khalaf, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), told Al Jazeera. \"People get attacked and beaten for doing nothing but appearing Muslim.\"\n\nThere were 155 anti-Muslim hate crimes committed against Arabs and Muslims in the US during 2012, according to the most recent FBI statistics.\u00c2 The deadliest of these was the Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin, in which a white supremacist, who incorrectly believed he was attacking Muslims, murdered six Sikhs and was shot by police before killing himself.\n\nSince the September 11 attacks, 30 new anti-Islamic hate groups have formed in the US, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which was founded in 1971 to combat racism against blacks in the American south.\u00c2 \"We've seen some horrible crimes committed against people who are perceived to be Arabs,\" Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn March, about 40 worshippers attended sunrise prayers at the Prayer Center of Orland Park, a suburban town south of Chicago, when a bullet was fired through the mosque dome. No one was injured in the incident. The Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations called on the FBI to investigate the incident as a hate crime, but no suspects have yet been identified.\n\nStarting in January 2015, the FBI's hate crimes unit will specifically track hate crimes against Arabs, a category the law enforcement agency had not previously recognised, said FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer. The FBI will also track hate crimes motivated by anti-Sikh and anti-Hindu sentiment.\n\nAt a June conference in Washington hosted by the ADC, participants said Arab Americans recognise they are in a continuing post-September 11 battle for civil rights. It's not just hate crimes: Arabs and Muslims in the US say they face rampant discrimination in every area of life.\u00c2 \"We are the blacks of the 21st century,\" said Azizah Y al-Hibri, the founder of Muslim Women Lawyers for Human Rights and a retired professor at the University of Richmond's Williams School of Law.\n\nA 2012 survey by the Arab American Institute found that 55 percent of Arab American Muslims have experienced discrimination and 71 percent fear future discrimination.\n\nArab Americans routinely encounter extra hassles while travelling, and\u00c2 Haytham Faraj, a Chicago-based defence attorney, claims prosecutors often\u00c2 exaggerate charges against Arab Americans by alleging serious crimes related to suspected spying or terrorism.\n\nA 'fear stronger than ever'\n\nSince 2010, the ADC says it has seen a surge in employment discrimination complaints. Last month, the group filed a discrimination lawsuit against an auto dealership in Lexington, Kentucky, on behalf of Easa Shadeh, a US citizen who was called a \"camel jockey\", and told by co-workers that Arabs are the \"new niggers\".\n\nDenyse Sabagh, head of the immigration practice group at law firm Duane Morris, said Arabs and Muslims encounter more bureaucratic delays and obstacles in the US immigration system than other minorities. \"I represent people from all over the world and the ones that seem to have the problems are Arabs and Muslims,\" she said.\n\nArabs and Muslims have long been portrayed as villains and enemies in American popular culture - cartoons, movies, television shows.

CSP will join other conservative groups such the Family Research Council, Liberty Counsel and WorldNetDaily, all of which SPLC has smeared by listing them alongside neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.\n\nThe SPLC is best known for its work decades ago fighting legal battles against segregation in the South. But it long ago morphed into a far left group with one purpose: manufacturing material to slander conservatives for use by the news media and on the Internet.\n\nCSP President Frank Gaffney has been on another SPLC hate list for several years along with American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray, Accuracy in Media President Cliff Kinkaid (who SPLC has singled out for challenging global warming), Robert Spencer (the founder of director of Jihad Watch blog), Lt. Gen. William \u201cJerry\u201d Boykin (executive vice president of the Family Research Council), WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah and other conservatives. Joining them on this list are an assortment of neo-Nazis, KKK members and white supremacists.\n\nDr. Ben Carson was placed on a SPLC \u201cextremist watch list\u201d in 2014 because of statements he made in defense of traditional marriage. But after a public outcry, the SPLC was forced to withdraw this designation and issue an apology to Carson in February 2015.\n\nAmong the many false claims in the SPLC\u2019s new list of hate groups is that Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy have been banned from participating in the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and that Gaffney\u2019s banishment from CPAC \u201cprobably earns him points with Trump.\u201d\n\nAlthough CPAC and the Center have had some differences in the past, this is no longer the case. Gaffney and the Center were present at CPAC last year and will have an expanded presence in 2016.\n\nI will be speaking at CPAC 2016 conference next month on behalf of the Center on the Iranian and North Korean missile programs.\n\nTo show how sloppy the SPLC\u2019s research is, a 2015 SPLC report noted that Gaffney and the Center were present at CPAC\u2019s 2015 conference and that the Center was a sponsor.\n\nAs ridiculous as the SPLC hate lists may sound, they often are taken seriously by the liberal media. These lists almost had deadly consequences in 2012 when Floyd Corkins, a volunteer at a gay-rights group, entered the office lobby of the Family Research Council with the intention of killing as many of the Council\u2019s employees as possible because of the organization\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nCorkins shot and injured a building manager before he was disarmed. He decided to launch a killing spree against the Family Research Council and another conservative organization after he read about their opposition to gay marriage in the SPLC\u2019s hate lists.\n\nWhile SPLC regularly lumps conservatives with neo-nazis and white supremacists for being anti-gay, anti-immigrant, Islamophobes, white nationalists or for miscellaneous hate (such disbelieving in global warming), it refuses to put liberal individuals and groups on their hate lists.\n\nFor example, the SPLC had nothing to say last summer when left wing groups like MoveOn.org, the Daily Kos, Credo and the National Iranian American Council attacked Jewish congressmen who opposed the nuclear deal with Iran like Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) by questioning their loyalty to this country.\n\nElliot Abrams decried this bigotry in an August 10, 2015 article in The Weekly Standard:\n\n\u201cThe basic idea is simple: to oppose the president\u2019s Iran deal means you want war with Iran, you\u2019re an Israeli agent, you are in the pay of Jewish donors, and you are abandoning the best interests of the United States. So Dan Pfeiffer, senior political adviser to Obama until this winter, tweeted that Senator Charles Schumer\u2014who announced his opposition to the Iran deal last week\u2014should not be Democratic leader in the Senate because he \u201cwants War with Iran.\u201d\n\nSPLC also has been silent on a growing anti-Semitism on the left and how American colleges are ignoring violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States.\n\nOn the other hand, the SPLC has joined President Obama in jumping on the fraudulent Islamophobia bandwagon. That\u2019s why CSP and Gaffney caught its attention.\n\nI join Frank Gaffney and everyone at the Center for Security Policy in strenuously condemning discrimination, mistreatment or violence against Muslims and members of any religious group.\n\nThe Islamophobia charges made against CSP and other critics of radical Islam have nothing to do with hate or bigotry \u2013 they are a ploy by Mr. Obama, American Muslim groups and liberal groups to sidestep how Islamist extremism represents, as American Islamic Forum for Democracy President Zuhdi Jasser has put it, \u201ca problem within the house of Islam.\u201d\n\nThis problem is the global jihad movement which is an ideology at war not just with modern society but also with the majority of the world\u2019s Muslims.\n\nThis is the real hate: Islamic supremacists cloaking their intolerance and hatred towards anyone who rejects their extremism \u2013 Muslims and non-Muslims \u2013 as protected religious practice. This hate includes brutalizing and killing groups that the SPLC claims to protect: women, LGBT individuals and racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nThe SPLC designated Frank Gaffney and the Center for Security Policy as \u201chaters\u201d because of our work to publicize the threat posed by to the supremacist Islamic shariah doctrine, a threat that President Obama and liberal groups refuse to confront or even name. They are in denial about this threat and instead condemn as bigots anyone who tries to address it.\n\nThis was crystal clear when President Obama on February 3 visited a mosque in Baltimore with known terrorist ties but refuses to meet with Muslims like Dr. Jasser who is leading an Islam reform movement that rejects Islamist radicalism and ISIS.\n\nAmerican leftwing groups like SPLC have also stubbornly ignored flagrantly hateful statements by some American Muslim groups.\n\nThere was a glaring example of this after the San Bernardino shooting when Hussam Ayloush, the Executive Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d \u201csome of our own foreign policy, as Americans, as the West have fueled that extremism. ... We are partly responsible.\u201d\n\nIn May 2004, Ayloush said the U.S. war on terror was a \u201cwar on Muslims,\u201d adding his belief that the 9/11 attacks were committed because of \u201cthe U.S.\u2019s unconditional support of Israel.\u201d The U.S. is Israel\u2019s \u201cpartner in crime\u201d against the Palestinians, Ayloush explained.\n\nHow can a supposed civil rights organization like the SPLC give Ayloush and CAIR a pass on such hateful statements and actions?\n\nHow can it not speak out against growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish students in Israel and the United States?\n\nOne reason is that the SPLC is not a civil rights organization \u2013 it is a far left advocacy group that tries to discredit its political enemies on the right with incoherent hate lists that wrongly associate them with notorious bigots to advance a liberal agenda. This is consistent with #12 of Saul Alinsky\u2019s \"Rules for Radicals\": \u201cPick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.\u201d\n\nSPLC also demonized conservatives with bogus hate charges because it has found this kind of fearmongering to be very lucrative. According to the SPLC\u2019s 2014 tax return, this non-profit organization had $54 million in revenue and $315 million in assets.\n\nBack in 2000, an investigative report into the SPLC\u2019s activities was published by Harper\u2019s Magazine titled The church of Morris Dees: How the Southern Poverty Law Center profits from intolerance. It described the SPLC and its activities as \u201cessentially a fraud\u201d that \u201cshuts down debate, stifles free speech, and most of all, raises a pile of money, very little of which is used on behalf of poor people.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the main reason the SPLC has been able to raise such huge sums because its president, Morris Dees, is so skilled at using scare mongering mailings for fund raising that in 1998 he was inducted into the Direct Mailing Association Hall of Fame.\n\nBased on its 2010 tax return, the liberal website Daily Kos criticized the SPLC in 2012 for its enormous wealth, offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands, and ownership in several foreign corporations.\n\nThe author of this article asked, \u201cWhat I'm very curious to learn is how keeping hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in assets, several offshore bank accounts and part ownership in foreign financial firms in any substantive way addresses poverty in America.\u201d\n\nI believe the SPLC\u2019s new focus on Islamophobia is because the organization has identified attacking critics of radical Islam as the ultimate money pot. For example, Saleh Abdulla Kamel, a Saudi banker believed to have been a financer of Usama bin Laden, gave $10 million to Yale University in 2015 to build an Islamic law center.\n\nGiven the SPLC\u2019s lack of scruples, greed and offshore operations, I believe it is very likely that this group is receiving funding from Gulf state billionaires like Kamel to discredit anyone who criticizes radical Islam and the global jihad movement.\n\nThe news media must stop being manipulated by the SPLC\u2019s calumny of its political enemies.\n\nReporters should realize that an organization which attacks all critics of radical Islam as Islamophobes, refuses to mention the extremism and intolerance of radical Islamist groups, and is silent on the growing anti-Semitism on the left and violence against Jewish university students cannot be considered a neutral and authoritative source.\n\nThe media also needs recognize that the SPLC\u2019s hate lists which lump Ben Carson, Frank Gaffney, Cliff Kinkaid and organizations like the Family Resource Council, WorldNet Daily and the Center for Security Policy with neo-Nazis and white supremacists are utter nonsense.\n\nThe press should instead be investigating the SPLC\u2019s enormous wealth, anonymous funders and how it is poisoning the public debate in this country to advance a liberal agenda and to enrich itself.\n\nFred Fleitz is senior vice president for policy and programs with the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, DC national security think tank.

The canon of Muslim dogma is rife with calls to martyrdom, forced conversion, and intolerance.\n\nWithout a vast reformation of the Muslim faith (which I don't see happening soon), the Islamic culture, especially in the Middle East, has only the superficial trappings of modernity surrounding a core of bronze age, obsolete morality. Note that the long-past, brief Islamic Golden Age occurred during an uncharacteristic period of religious tolerance and liberalism. There is a reason these metrics go hand-in-hand with prosperity.\n\nAlmost all religions, including Christianity, are holding back the progress of humanity toward a more balanced and ethical framework that can address the issues of our modern world. But Islam is by far the most egregious throwback.\n\nI don't understand why this would be a \"racist\" argument. I'm against a set of socially destructive ideas, beliefs and actions, not an ethnic group.\n\nHonestly, I think peak oil will solve our problems in the long term. Once the oil is gone, we can remove all of our military bases from the Middle East. Our bases have been distracting them from their own meaningless conflicts.\n\nPosted by: platypus_chutney | June 15, 2010 10:10 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nNote that there are likely many secularists and liberals in Muslim countries.

Jews have been burnt alive by Christians, where as ARABS and Muslims Protected them and gave them shelter. Look what CHRITIANS did to the NATIVE people of south and norh AMERICA,GENOCIDE. How the so called CHRISTIANS ENSLAVED Millions of Africans.Christians have done the most Cruel and inhumane things to people of all faiths.Christians are living in the past.They want to DOMINATE other people like they did in the past, but things are adversly changing for them. Now, all the oppressed people are rising against the past colonialists. Countries like China, India, Brazil are marching ahead along with the Muslims.The past oppressors like Spain, Britain, France and Potugal are in deep decline so is U.S.A.

However, my tolerance has been eroded over the last 15 years as I watch in horror at what Islam has wrought.\n\nThank you, platypus_chutney, for saving me the effort of typing; your post summarized my position exactly. I would add only a couple of points that I didn't think you touched on:\n\nFirst, the murderous misogyny of radical Islam. I cannot tolerate a religion which reduces women to mere chattle, giving men the legal power of life and death over them. I condemn Christian and Jewish sects of similar atrocities, but Islam is the one I am reading about on a daily basis (think \"honor\" killings and female genital mutulation). Unacceptable.\n\nSecond, the expectation of immigrant Muslim communities around the world that they will merely establish strongholds in which their religion, culture and laws will supercede the host country's. UNacceptable.\n\nI think that anti-Muslim sentiment is going continue to grow, not only here but everywhere; it is becoming a matter of cultural survival.\n\nPosted by: Orsalia | June 15, 2010 1:20 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nPam Geller, get over yourself, you're no martyr, just a knuckle-dragging slug who can't take the same kind of strong language, vitriol and histrionics that you dish out, which is why Charles Johnson smartly disassociated his blog from yours.\n\nAnd the rest of your diseased ilk proudly bloviating their hatred in this thread are no better than those they criticize.\n\nNo one religion is more legitimate than another, they're all a matter of belief, not fact.\n\nPosted by: kingcranky | June 15, 2010 1:20 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nFor those who see Muslims as the enemy, I urge you to see socio-economics as much as an issue, as well as tolerancce for others. 20 men were indocrinated by hatred to bomb America and we are seeing an extension of that in Jihad in our wars in the Middle East. But get to know your local muslim neighbors in America and see that they want the same thigs you do - decent schools, safe neighborhoods, stable jobs. Muslims are no differant from Christians, the disposessed will still lash out, the reactionary groups will still be full of hate.

Moderate Muslims themselves are fighting this pervasive influence that has been gathering more and more strength with oil money. There is nothing anti-Muslim about efforts to combat extremists who profess their fascist terror in the name of Islam. For the first time, men and women in traditionally moderate Muslim-majority countries like Malaysia are being canned and jailed for drinking beer. Islam is the ONLY religion that has a police force to enforce rules made up by the local Islamic council. If it is the religion of peace, why is so much punishment meted out to its own followers? Why is a Muslim not allowed to depart Islam, under punishment of death? Wake up Americans. Islam is NOT the same as other religions.\n\nPosted by: legitbrownie | June 15, 2010 5:20 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\n\"but why aren't the \"moderate\" muslims decrying the beheadings, homicide bombings and hiding their fighters behind women and children??!?!\"\n\nYou answered your own question. Its very hard to get the press, or anyone else for that matter, to pay attention to you if you're a moderate--even if moderates are in the majority. The Tea Partiers, the Earth First'ers, Hamas--all get much more press than warranted given their small numbers.\n\nPosted by: youba | June 15, 2010 5:22 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\n\"but why aren't the \"moderate\" muslims decrying the beheadings, homicide bombings and hiding their fighters behind women and children??!?!\" Unfortunately, a common tactic of control is thuggery. \"Moderate\" Muslims are being bullied and subjugated to extreme pressure to toe the line of the extremists. Muslims are not allowed to question the teachings or what some cleric professes. So as Wahhabists take over mosques (with their money), the moderate preachers are being pushed out. This period of Islam is equivalent to the dark ages of Christianity when illiterates were merely told what was presumably in the holy book. Most Muslims have never read the Koran because they do not read Arabic. Translations are forbidden (one of many forbidden activities as part of the control and command procedures).\n\nPosted by: legitbrownie | June 15, 2010 6:26 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nthere is no place in the western hemisphere for muslims...period.\n\nPosted by: OldSalt8 | June 15, 2010 6:48 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nNo secular person from western civilization with any sense could advocate the importation of the muslim social cancer.

As a revert to Islam, embracing Islam as an adult, freely and after a thorough evaluation using the intellectual capacities given by God, I naturally find the 'skin-head', emotionally charged Islamophobic trend disturbing, yet, what I find fascinating is the fear some have that Islamic sharia could actually influence state and federal government. I don't believe that would ever happen, yet, Islam continues to grow, gaining adherents who choose to embrace freely despite the tremendous efforts being made to defeat God's religion. This is due to the fact that Islam is self-perpetuating, a sign of its divine nature. With certain people spewing venom against Islam and Muslims, then finding Americans embracing it, how can you explain that?\n\nPosted by: Muslimbychoice | June 16, 2010 12:59 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nOne single fact remains; Islam is growing globally despite the psychotic efforts to defeat it. The PEW foundation found approximately 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide. Despite the concerted, 'steroid' loaded efforts that surely consume some of these individuals who wish to destroy Islam and Muslims, people are willfully embracing Islam, often without help or prodding, just reading online, watching the beautiful manners of a good Muslim they know or after reading the rants of the 'rantors', and knowing that is coming from deep seated phobias and allegiances to others. This is the self-perpetuating nature of Islam and another sign of its divine nature.\n\nPosted by: Muslimbychoice | June 16, 2010 1:07 AM Report Offensive Comment"], "summary": ["Where is this anti-Muslim movement going?"]}]
