Can a computer pass the \u201cTuring Test,\u201d fooling a human in two-way conversation? Can a system learn to pick stocks better than a human (or for that matter, a monkey with a dartboard)? The common thread in these examples is the choice of yardstick the AI systems should be measured against: humans. Frequently, however, humans are not only the measure of success, but also part of the problem.\n\nAI systems have had varying degrees of success when measured against humans. In problems such as chess, which succumb to sheer computational firepower, the machines have advanced greatly in a short time. In 1996, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue became the first machine ever to win even a single game against the reigning world champion, Garry Kasparov. Fast-forward to 2006, and the chess-playing computer Deep Fritz defeated undisputed world champion Vladimir Kramnik in 4 games to 2. As long as Moore\u2019s Law continues, ever more powerful computers available at ever decreasing prices will eventually put the chess-processing power of today\u2019s grandmasters in our children\u2019s hands.\n\nBut chess is a game of full information: All the pieces are visible to both players, there is a strict turn-based protocol and success is clearly defined. Full information implies that all of the participants know all available information. In addition, chess is not \u201cpath dependent\u201d\u2013the pieces are where they are, and it (largely) doesn\u2019t matter how they got there. This makes calculating the value of a given position significantly easier.\n\nIn the murkier world of poker, however, the game is not as much about playing the table, but playing the opponent. At any given moment, one needs not just to calculate pre- and post-flop probabilities\u2013and implied and actual pot odds\u2013but also evaluate the intentions of the other players, all while trying to figure out what they\u2019re holding. This is done as the hand evolves, and thus decisions are highly path-dependent. If all players followed a fixed rational, consistent and non-deceptive strategy, computers might have a good shot at estimating the likely holdings of their competitors, and therefore winning. It is the uncertainty injected by their human opponents that makes machine victory much harder. This is why, despite the much greater financial incentive compared to chess, computers have extremely limited success in poker. At the championship level, computers are nowhere close to poker pros like Daniel Negranu or Phil Ivey.\n\nLike chess, financial-market orthodoxy is based on several related principles: the idea of full information, the supposition of rational participants and the lack of path-dependency. Rational human actors are supposed to be calculating the odds, maximizing return and minimizing risk. This creates path-independent market evolution, because the belief is that markets are instantaneously efficient and reflect all information in current asset prices.\n\nIf this were indeed the case, AI would stand a good chance at bettering its human counterparts in making and capitalizing on market decisions. Unfortunately, rationality is not always the best assumption for either humans or markets. One needs to look no further than the current economic situation to observe how irrational human traits like confidence, fear and greed play out in market dynamics. The uncertainty injected by the human participants makes the markets much harder to predict.\n\nThis evidence of human economic irrationality is increasingly supported by experimental data. Behavioral economics experiments consistently find persistent, irrational human biases. Our evolutionary history has ingrained many once-desirable traits in our \u201cwetware.\u201d A long time spent in the middle of the food chain, for example, has made our brains very good at perceiving complex patterns where none exist\u2013the risk of being eaten by leopards leads to seeing leopard spots more often than seeing actual leopards. Our ancestors who had this skill were eaten less often than those who didn\u2019t.\n\nUnfortunately, these beneficial evolutionarily traits may be incompatible with the cool calculation of risk and return in our hypothetical rational actor trading in modern financial markets. In fact, many studies have shown that contrary to traditional assumptions, humans\u2019 economic decisions are often highly path-dependent. The value we attach to a 50-50 chance of finishing with $0 or $100 depends on how much we have to start. These hard-wired human biases lead to the inevitable herding, anchoring, regime shifts and bubbles and crashes we see throughout history. If our goal is to build intelligent systems to beat the markets, we cannot simply ignore irrationality. As Keynes famously remarked, \u201cthe markets can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent.\u201d Longer, too, than can an AI trading system.\n\nSo, is there a path forward? Game theorists (and poker pros) will tell us that when faced with adaptive opponents, a fixed strategy is doomed. Our world is not made up of full information and \u201crational\u201d actors. We have probabilities, uncertainty and distributions of outcomes. The same experiment will never be performed under the exact same conditions again.\n\nTraining a financial trading system to deliver the single best model given the data will most often lead to models that fit the past at the expense of predicting the future. What are needed are systems that are flexible, adapt to changing circumstances and are, at their core, probabilistic rather than deterministic. By having distributions of possible models for the state of the world, we can balance the competing desires for certainty and flexibility. By retraining the models automatically when results begin to drift relative to expectations, we can achieve some of the adaptability that humans exhibit in the face of shifts. The path to beating the markets lies in building systems that understand, but do not emulate, the persistent biases in human nature. Success in artificial intelligence may require a fundamental understanding of how flawed our human yardsticks often are.\n\nBack to the AI Report\n\nJoshua Holden is the president and CEO of Fina Technologies, which applies machine-learning techniques to create advanced quantitative trading systems.\n\nComments are turned off for this post."], "summary": ["Finance is more like poker than chess."]}, {"title": ["Refusing vaccination is anti-social, not irrational"], "text": ["By Robert Stoker February 10 at 11:58 AM\n\nThe recent outbreak of measles in Disneyland and the increase in measles cases nationwide have led to public health concerns, as well as a backlash against parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. Most media coverage has framed the issue as science versus irrationality, ignorance, and fear. However, this framing misses a key motivation for refusing vaccination. In some cases, the problem arguably isn\u2019t the reluctance of anti-vaccine parents to accept overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. It\u2019s that anti-vaccine parents are exploiting others by behaving rationally and strategically.\n\nPublic health experts see parents who refuse to vaccinate their children as irrational people who cannot accept clear and convincing evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. Public health experts encourage vaccination by emphasizing our vast historical experience with vaccines and the absence of significant side effects. Some commentators have linked parental decisions to refuse vaccines to broader skepticism about science and experts. However, vaccine skeptics have pushed back, claiming that they have conducted research and made independent judgments about risks of vaccination based on the evidence.\n\nPublic health experts do not argue that vaccination is risk free. Rather, they argue that the risk of vaccination is insignificant compared to the public health benefit from preventing the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases. This is settled science. However, parents who decide not to vaccinate their children are not deciding whether to have their children live in a world without vaccines. Their choice is whether or not to subject their own child to the very slight risk of vaccine-related side effects or instead to make their child a rare exception by refusing vaccination.\n\nPublic health research reluctantly acknowledges that rational parents may refuse to vaccinate their kids. This survey looked at parents of intentionally undervaccinated children in San Diego following a measles outbreak in 2008. A child is intentionally undervaccinated when the parent refuses or delays vaccination. The survey revealed that most of the children\u2019s families were affluent, white and college-educated. It\u2019s extremely unlikely that most of these parents were motivated by religious concerns. Vaccine skeptics moderated their views when they considered the possibility of international travel (which would be likely to expose their kids to more infectious diseases). It\u2019s also clear from the survey that these parents had accepted some debunked claims about the risks of vaccination, in particular the possibility that vaccination may cause autism or other adverse reactions. But this doesn\u2019t fully explain why parents decided not to vaccinate.\n\nA second, experimental study of motivations for immunization provides a clue. This study identified altruism, free riding and bandwagon effects as affecting these decisions. This highlights, as the authors note, a clash between public health concerns and individual self-interest. People who accept vaccination not only reduce their own chances of contracting contagious diseases, they also reduce the possibility that they will transmit the disease to others. This \u201cherd immunity\u201d provides a social benefit. Altruistic people are motivated in part by this social benefit when they get vaccinated. However, others see things differently. As the proportion of the population that is vaccinated grows, the individual benefits of vaccination decline, because people are less likely to contract the disease. This makes it more attractive for people to free ride on the vaccination decisions of others. The results of the experiment show that people experience cross-cutting motivations when making vaccination decisions. Bandwagon effects were the most powerful motivating force, suggesting that people are most likely to get their children vaccinated when others around them are doing the same. However, differences in people\u2019s levels of altruism and willingness to free ride also affected their decisions, especially when the issues of vaccination were framed in particular ways.\n\nThis clinical report in Pediatrics provides further evidence that parents may refuse vaccination because they are making a strategic decision to exploit herd immunity by free riding on the affirmative vaccination decisions of others. Parents who refuse immunization on behalf of their children are, in a sense, free riders who take advantage of the benefit created by the participation and assumption of immunization risk or burden by others while refusing to participate in the program themselves (p. 1429).\n\nAnti-vaccine parents do not live in a world in which they weigh the risk of infectious diseases versus the risk of vaccination. They live in a world in which their child faces only very slight risks of contracting infectious disease, due to the decisions of all the other socially responsible parents around them who vaccinate their children. This allows them \u2014 if they are narrowly self-interested \u2014 to avoid the even slighter risk of side effects from vaccination. It is only the socially responsible decision of parents who vaccinate their children that allows anti-vaccine parents to live in that world.\n\nWhen you put it all together, this evidence suggests that vaccine refusal can be strategic and rational. Many people who refuse to vaccinate their children do not fit the profile of irrational science skeptics; they are affluent and well-educated. In addition, skeptics are more likely to accept vaccinations when there is lower protection from herd immunity (as during international travel). Experimental research shows that people are likely to recognize and exploit vaccination decisions made by others. Clinical advice from pediatricians identifies free riding as a substantial barrier to affirmative vaccination decisions.\n\nFree riders may be anti-social, but they are not irrational. To the contrary, free riders are rationally pursuing their narrow, individual self-interest by exploiting the socially responsible behavior of everyone else. This may, of course, eventually make things worse for everyone. It may also be self-defeating, especially if free riders are clustered together. However, education about the social benefits of vaccines is unlikely to solve the problem of selfishly rational people who refuse to vaccinate their kids. What\u2019s needed instead is government intervention to enforce socially responsible (though not individually risk-free) norms.\n\nRobert Stoker is an associate professor of political science and public policy at George Washington University."], "summary": ["It may be rational not to vaccinate your kids, since vaccines carry very slight risks.

It\u2019s good to correct the record, of course, but careless tweets are not really the problem with his reporting. His broadcasts reflect the anguish of millions who identify with his passion about the \"innocent children too broken by battle to survive\".\n\nNo, the real problem is political; Snow has three disabling illusions about Hamas.\n\n1. Snow thinks Hamas are a negotiating partner-in-waiting being ignored by Israel, but they aren\u2019t.\n\n\"Why not speak to Hamas directly? You haven\u2019t got the courage!\" Snow shouted at the Israeli spokesman Mark Regev on 16 July.\n\nThe problem with that argument is not simply that Hamas considers the destruction of Israel is sacred work or that its Charter says \"Islam will obliterate Israel\" and enjoins all good Muslims to kill Jews, whom it blames for all the wars and revolutions.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t even that the Hamas foreign minister, Mahmoud al-Zahar, has said \"Israel is a vile entity that has been planted on our soil, and has no historical, religious or cultural legitimacy. We cannot normalise our relations with this entity \u2026 [We say] no to recognising Israel, regardless of the price we have to pay [for our refusal].\"\n\nOr even that Aqsa TV (Hamas) broadcast this message on 9 July: \"Zionists, wait and see terror attacks, stabbing everywhere. Wait for suicide attacks on every bus, caf\u00e9 and street. Wait for the rage and for revenge for Gaza, wait for the flames of the West Bank, inside you.\"\n\nThe underlying problem is that Snow, like many Western liberals, tends to treat pathological movements with no negotiable grievance as if they are rational political movements with grievances that can be negotiated.\n\nI interviewed Paul Berman, the author of Terror and Liberalism, in 2006 and he told me that this \"rationalist naivety\" is built into the liberal idea. We liberals make a division in our own minds between the rational and the theological and we divide society as a whole in the same way (church here, state there).\n\nThat\u2019s fine. But then we make a terrible error: we imagine everyone else, deep down, thinks like us.\n\nAnd that error makes it impossible for us to grasp the nature of many modern religio-political movements, especially radical political Islam. As Berman put it:\n\nIn the pre-modern age the rational and the irrational could both be understood. This became impossible after the rise of liberalism as political language became impoverished. \u2026 In the political world, just as in the economic world, we wanted to accord everyone rationality, so we took all the questions of irrationality and put them in a different place entirely. It became very difficult to conceive that people might be behaving in irrational ways or might have succumbed to the allure of a cult of death.\n\n2. Snow thinks Hamas grew as a popular reaction to the blockade, but it didn\u2019t.\n\nOn July 20 Snow tweeted, \"If you strangle a people, deny them supply, for years, extreme reaction is inevitable. The one begets the other.\"\n\nAs a generality, that is a truism. But as an analysis of the current conflict in Gaza it is based on the fallacy that the Israeli blockade of Gaza led to Hamas rockets from Gaza. In fact, the rockets led to the blockade. Israel got out of Gaza in 2005 hoping for co-existence. Hamas bomb-maker Mohammed Deif responded by declaring jihad for the destruction of Israel and quadrupling the rocket attacks.\n\nSnow\u2019s tweet also ignores the simple truth that as soon as Hamas accepts the reasonable conditions set by the entire international community \u2013- accept Israel\u2019s right to exist, end the rockets and terror, adhere to agreements entered into by the PLO \u2013 then a new relationship becomes possible.\n\n3. Snow thinks the ordinary people he talks to in Gaza can speak freely about Hamas but they can\u2019t.\n\nBack in 2009 an Israeli tried to point out to Snow that what Gazans say to reporters is self-censored because Hamas run an authoritarian regime, \"Gaza is a very authoritarian regime, sir, do you deny that?\" asked the spokesman. Snow replied angrily, \"There is no question of [our reporter] having been strong-armed by Hamas, or indeed, the people that he has spoken to being strong-armed by Hamas.\" (2009)\n\n\"Everybody here hates Hamas. But they're too afraid to say so publicly. Our food comes from Israel but what we give them in return is rockets.\" said Abu Ali last week. A driver with a family business in Gaza he spoke to the Associated Press, only after receiving a guarantee that only his first names would be used, to avoid Hamas retribution. And even that was brave.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky pointed out that when journalists and activists forget that there is a \"black-and-white line that divides free societies from fear societies\" they end up creating an upside-down world in which \"a strong dictator can be seen as a reliable partner for peace\". In the name of peace, \"pacifists in the West marched alongside emissaries of the KGB who, posing as peace activists, sought to undermine the efforts of as free world to defend itself against Soviet aggression\". The tyrants deliberately twist our \"deep desire for peace\", wrote Sharansky, and \"turn [it] into a weapon of tyranny\".\n\nSnow\u2019s passion about the terrible toll of this conflict is shared by most. But his political illusions in Hamas are pushing him towards the Fox or MSNBC style of news-as-political-editorialising.

It's just a movie treatment, right? So why not (as the film's makers suggest) just let it go?.\n\nBut that is to misunderstand how defending the literal truth of Noachian flood and the Genesis creation story is wrapped up in a broader battle to defend Christian faith and the notion of absolute truth against a rising tide of scientific materialism and moral relativism.\n\nTo be sure, the Creationists have tied themselves in some terrible knots over the decades as they try to put a scientific gloss on their literal beliefs.\n\nMuch of it certainly is scientifically irrational, such as the attempt to cook up explanations for how Noah squeezed all the dinosaurs onto his ark, or explain the chronological layers of the fossil record with the idea that the small animals sunk to the bottom of sediment left by The Flood before the larger mammals, who could swim, followed them later.\n\nThis stuff is easy to ridicule, but it misses the true underlying rationale for American biblical literalism \u2013 which is to defend the faith, often to a scientifically illiterate population.\n\nIt has been a hundred years war. As Ronald Numbers writes in The Creationists, his definitive history of the movement in all its many guises, five decades after Darwin published the Origin of Species in 1859 there wasn't a single serious scientist who challenged the evolutionary hypothesis.\n\nThat changed after the First World War, when public schooling took off in America and the nation's children started to learn of a scientific version of the world in their classrooms that appeared profoundly at odds with what they were being told from the pulpit on Sundays.\n\nCreationism and biblical literalism has taken on many forms and degrees in the intervening century \u2013 from literalist Young Earth Creationist to the purveyors of Intelligent Design, which essentially rebranded old ideas \u2013 but all to the same end. Defending the faith.\n\nBarbara Forrest, philosophy professor at Louisiana Southern University long-time battler against Creationism, says the rationale behind pushing Creationist belief is very clear.\n\n\"The notion is that if you teach children a purely naturalistic explanation for the origin of life, that leaves God out of the equation, you are teaching atheism and a scientific materialism that opens you up to a moral relativism,\" she tells me.\n\nAdd to that the fact that America has a proud tradition of anti-intellectualism born out the necessities of a settler culture where practical skills were lauded and 'book-learning' scoffed at, and you can see how literalism took root in a way that it did not in Britain.\n\nOver the years, explains Prof Numbers, those pushing the Biblical view of the origin of the world have often actively tried to make Darwinism synonymous with immorality, blaming evolutionary theory for unleashing a torrent of ills, from fascism and communism to rising rates of divorce, sexual promiscuity and venereal disease.\n\nMuch of this might be irrational \u2013 though there were always grains of truth \u2013 but the demonisation and biblical literalism served a rational purpose, which was to set up a bulwark against a rising tide of secularism, and a simple creed to rally around.\n\nWhen so-called \"intelligent design\" came along, its exponents were explicit about their intentions, writing in the infamous Wedge Document of 1998 that Darwin, Marx and Freud had debunked the traditional conceptions of God and man and portrayed humans as \"machines\".\n\n\"The cultural consequences of the triumph of materialism were devastating,\" they wrote as they set up the Seattle-based Discovery Institute, that still pedals the old ideas. \"Such moral relativism was uncritically adopted by much of the social sciences, and it still undergirds much of modern economics, political science, psychology and sociology.\"\n\nThe Institute therefore avowedly sought, and still seeks, \"nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its cultural legacies\".\n\nThat might be a tall order \u2013 the courts in the US have consistently thwarted their designs to get creation science into schools \u2013 but that doesn't mean that while ultimately appearing to lose the war, they haven't had successes along the way.\n\nAfter all, compared to European nations, America has successfully defied the nexus between rising prosperity and declining religiosity, although as Mark Chaves pointed out recently that may now be starting to change as even Evangelical congregations appear to be succumbing to the forces of secularisation.\n\nBut viewed in a historical context, asking the faithful to defend the Bible, and the literal truth of the Genesis creation story and Noachian flood is a rational response to the rising tide of scientific reason that brought in all kinds of morally questionable flotsam and jetsam.\n\nRational and \u2013 up until now, at least \u2013 remarkably effective.\n\nListen to our weekly podcast:"], "summary": ["Russell Crowe has fumed against religious groups\u00a0who have\u00a0objected to\u00a0Noah,\u00a0his new\u00a0movie which\u00a0premieres in the\u00a0UK\u00a0on Monday, calling their criticism \"irrational\".

In principle, this isn\u2019t irrational. The United States has often stood as a beacon of individual liberty over tyranny. But it becomes destructive when people resist government because of irrational fears and suspicions. To protect people from threats, government has a legitimate role. In the case of measles, the threat is a highly contagious virus that can bring serious consequences. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cMeasles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.\u201d This is why states have passed laws mandating vaccination for children attending public schools (although 17 states, including California, scene of the outbreak at Disneyland, have waivers for personal beliefs, and 48 have waivers for religious beliefs).\n\nBoth the governor and senator seem to be suggesting that it is fine for parents to avoid vaccinations for their children. But is this really a matter of individual rights? Liberty does not confer the right to endanger others \u2014 whether at a school or Disneyland or anywhere else.\n\nMore broadly, a president must make decisions every day about science, and it is not always easy; consider the struggle over climate change, the hard-fought debate over the impact of the Keystone XL pipeline, the promise of genetically modified foods, the intensifying threat of cyberattacks and the growing danger of antimicrobial resistance. Every one of these requires decision-makers to be rational and clear-eyed, the president most of all.\n\nIn the case of measles, proven science is well in hand. The vaccine has a half-century record of safety and effectiveness. The study linking it to autism has been discredited and retracted. Mr. Paul\u2019s reporting of anecdotes that he has \u201cheard\u201d is particularly insidious. Measles was eliminated in the United States by 2000 with widespread use of the vaccine. No presidential candidate should endorse parental \u201cchoice\u201d that could reopen the door to an ugly and preventable disease."], "summary": ["Rand Paul and Chris Christie raise doubts about their fitness for higher office."]}, {"title": ["Can you be 'entitled' to bigotry?

Mark Silk, professor of religion and public life at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., blogging at Spiritual Politics, says irrational fear of mosques is not only for politicians. It's now being wielded by the Anti-Defamation League's leader Abraham Foxman, who issued a statement opposing an effort to build an an Islamic Center near Ground Zero.

The story and the issue isn't even about race or African-Americans, but you make this statement about \"racist black groups\". The very idea - the very argument - accusing liberals or African-Americans of racism is an \"I-know-you-are-but-what-Am-I?\" projection argument in defense of the criticism of racism of conservative rhetoric and positions. It's a defense of racism. This is a common argument among conservatives, and while it might play well to conservatives who watch, read, or listen to their favorite conservative pundits, it makes them all look racists whether they actually are or are just parroting political rhetoric they've picked up from others.\n\nIf someone doesn't want to be viewed as a racist, then they should refrain from making arguments that were proposed as a defense of racism.\n\nI have never once heard a Liberal news-anchor say or imply a Black organization (such as the black panthers) could be racist.\n\nYou mean The New Black Panther Party. This group is seen as a hate group. The Anti-Defamation League and The Southern Poverty Law Center have listed this group as a hate group. Bobby Seale and the Huey Foundation have said that this group is illegitimate and that there is no \"New\" Black Panther party.\n\nThe idea that since you have not heard a \"liberal news anchor\" declare the New Black Panther Party as a racist group, is not a good premise to support that proposition, which is clearly false. The New Black Panther Party is considered a hate group, and is described as that by liberals.\n\nBut they go on and on about how Whites discriminate\n\nNo, they go on about how the basis of many conservative arguments are racist.\n\nThese arguments are explicitly designed to appeal to racists. The greatest electoral shift in American history occurred when Southern Democrats left the party after the party supported the Voting Rights and Civil Rights Act. There's a very famous political expression regarding this: \"I didn't leave the democratic party, the democratic party left me.\"\n\nAll these southern states, which are now deeply red, were, before this schism, just as deeply blue. these people were southern white racists. The Republican Party made overtures to these people in the late 60s and 70s by giving them rhetoric and racial wedge issues to bring them into the party. this is the origin of the demographic 'social conservative'. There was no such term before. It was invented as a way to talk about this group of people who formed the base of the GOP but who weren't Right Wing. You had to talk about them but what do you call them? The angry bigots? The ignorant rednecks? The white trash wing? Social Conservatives is a good term that describes them without being offensive, separates them from the Right Wing, and brings them into \"conservatism\" by giving them that name.\n\nBut while they may self-identify as 'Right Wing', they aren't. Right Wing is specific to a socioeconomic demographic and the economic best interests of those people. It's about 3-5 % of the population and might include those that hope to someday be the right wing, but the rest are left wing. If your income isn't in the top percentages, then you're not right wing. But they don't what right wing means or the goals of the coalition that they've joined. It's a coalition put together originally by Hamilton in the 1790s, and as an economy is a zero sum game, voting right wing when one is left wing is against one's own best interest.\n\nBut to these people, the bargain seems to be \" Hey, vote for our guys and adopt our positions on economic policies and when we get in, we'll screw the people that you don't like.\" And over these last few decades, these people have gone from the uneasiness of supporting 'Northeastern liberals' who just happen to now be conservative - real conservative - and Right Wing, to supporting these economic policies as being as absolute, universal, timeless truths and American pie. But in reality, their prewar ancestors fought, sometimes physically, for labor rights against this same coalition.\n\nIn any event - yeah, the base of the GOP are, in general a bunch of racists. This is a problem for the GOP, they are having trouble winning elections and seem to be , not just heading, but falling into a permanent minority and a regional party. this issue was much discussed earlier this year, and many conservatives were offended by the attitudes of the GOP leadership and traditional conservative pundits, leading to many of them starting to refer to themselves as 'independents'.\n\n. As far as Radical Islam, it is ignored more often then it should be.\n\nIgnored? Really? It is clearly not ignored.\n\nBut again, the issue here isn't militant Islam, but that conservative arguments and comments paint all Muslims as militant or as terrorists. that's irrational and racist.\n\nBut please tell me, what in my earlier comment was so racist it adds to the stereotype of Conservatives being hateful racist bigots?\n\nAgain - 'black hate groups' and droning on about Islam. The entire conservative 'Holy War' narrative is insane and racist.

Conservatives want to war with Islam and kill Muslims, innocent or not, simply because they're Muslims - which is exactly the thinking of militant Muslims toward Americans. It's really just the right Wing @!$%#s of two different cultures making problems for the innocent and the rational of both cultures.

Back in the 1950s, when the philosopher Alvin Plantinga was getting his start, there were scarcely more religious believers in academic philosophy departments.\n\nThe philosopher Alvin Plantinga, whose new book is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion and Naturalism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrowing up among Dutch Calvinist immigrants in the Midwest, Mr. Plantinga was used to intense theological debate. But when he arrived at Harvard as an undergraduate, he was startled to find equal intensity marshaled in favor of the argument that God didn\u2019t exist, when classmates and teachers found the question worth arguing about.\n\nHad he not transferred to Calvin College, the Christian Reformed liberal arts college in Grand Rapids, Mich., where his father taught psychology, Mr. Plantinga wrote in a 1993 essay, he doubted that he \u201cwould have remained a Christian at all; certainly Christianity or theism would not have been the focal point of my adult intellectual life.\u201d\n\nBut he did return, and the larger world of philosophy has been quite different as a result. From Calvin, and later from the University of Notre Dame, Mr. Plantinga has led a movement of unapologetically Christian philosophers who, if they haven\u2019t succeeded in persuading their still overwhelmingly unbelieving colleagues, have at least made theism philosophically respectable.\n\n\u201cThere are vastly more Christian philosophers and vastly more visible or assertive Christian philosophy now than when I left graduate school,\u201d Mr. Plantinga said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Grand Rapids, adding, with characteristic modesty, \u201cI have no idea how it happened.\u201d\n\nMr. Plantinga retired from full-time teaching last year, with more than a dozen books and a past presidency of the American Philosophical Association to his name. But he\u2019s hardly resting on those laurels. Having made philosophy safe for theism, he\u2019s now turning to a harder task: making theism safe for science.\n\nFor too long, Mr. Plantinga contends in a new book, theists have been on the defensive, merely rebutting the charge that their beliefs are irrational. It\u2019s time for believers in the old-fashioned creator God of the Bible to go on the offensive, he argues, and he has some sports metaphors at the ready.

Dennett, spiced up with some trash talk of his own.\n\nMr. Dawkins? \u201cDancing on the lunatic fringe,\u201d Mr. Plantinga declares. Mr. Dennett? A reverse fundamentalist who proceeds by \u201cinane ridicule and burlesque\u201d rather than by careful philosophical argument.\n\nOn the telephone Mr. Plantinga was milder in tone but no less direct. \u201cIt seems to me that many naturalists, people who are super-atheists, try to co-opt science and say it supports naturalism,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a complete mistake and ought to be pointed out.\u201d\n\nThe so-called New Atheists may claim the mantle of reason, not to mention a much wider audience, thanks to best sellers like Mr. Dawkins\u2019s fire-breathing polemic, \u201cThe God Delusion.\u201d But while Mr. Plantinga may favor the highly abstruse style of analytic philosophy, to him the truth of the matter is crystal clear.\n\nTheism, with its vision of an orderly universe superintended by a God who created rational-minded creatures in his own image, \u201cis vastly more hospitable to science than naturalism,\u201d with its random process of natural selection, he writes. \u201cIndeed, it is theism, not naturalism, that deserves to be called \u2018the scientific worldview.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Plantinga readily admits that he has no proof that God exists. But he also thinks that doesn\u2019t matter. Belief in God, he argues, is what philosophers call a basic belief: It is no more in need of proof than the belief that the past exists, or that other people have minds, or that one plus one equals two.\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t sensibly claim theistic belief is irrational without showing it isn\u2019t true,\u201d Mr. Plantinga said.

Collins, M.D., Ph.D., is the director of the Human Genome Project. His most recent book is \"The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief.\"\n\nROCKVILLE, Maryland (CNN) -- I am a scientist and a believer, and I find no conflict between those world views.\n\nAs the director of the Human Genome Project, I have led a consortium of scientists to read out the 3.1 billion letters of the human genome, our own DNA instruction book. As a believer, I see DNA, the information molecule of all living things, as God's language, and the elegance and complexity of our own bodies and the rest of nature as a reflection of God's plan.\n\nI did not always embrace these perspectives. As a graduate student in physical chemistry in the 1970s, I was an atheist, finding no reason to postulate the existence of any truths outside of mathematics, physics and chemistry. But then I went to medical school, and encountered life and death issues at the bedsides of my patients. Challenged by one of those patients, who asked \"What do you believe, doctor?\", I began searching for answers.\n\nI had to admit that the science I loved so much was powerless to answer questions such as \"What is the meaning of life?\" \"Why am I here?\" \"Why does mathematics work, anyway?\" \"If the universe had a beginning, who created it?\" \"Why are the physical constants in the universe so finely tuned to allow the possibility of complex life forms?\" \"Why do humans have a moral sense?\" \"What happens after we die?\" (Watch Francis Collins discuss how he came to believe in God )\n\nI had always assumed that faith was based on purely emotional and irrational arguments, and was astounded to discover, initially in the writings of the Oxford scholar C.S. Lewis and subsequently from many other sources, that one could build a very strong case for the plausibility of the existence of God on purely rational grounds. My earlier atheist's assertion that \"I know there is no God\" emerged as the least defensible. As the British writer G.K. Chesterton famously remarked, \"Atheism is the most daring of all dogmas, for it is the assertion of a universal negative.\"\n\nBut reason alone cannot prove the existence of God. Faith is reason plus revelation, and the revelation part requires one to think with the spirit as well as with the mind. You have to hear the music, not just read the notes on the page. Ultimately, a leap of faith is required.\n\nFor me, that leap came in my 27th year, after a search to learn more about God's character led me to the person of Jesus Christ. Here was a person with remarkably strong historical evidence of his life, who made astounding statements about loving your neighbor, and whose claims about being God's son seemed to demand a decision about whether he was deluded or the real thing. After resisting for nearly two years, I found it impossible to go on living in such a state of uncertainty, and I became a follower of Jesus.\n\nSo, some have asked, doesn't your brain explode? Can you both pursue an understanding of how life works using the tools of genetics and molecular biology, and worship a creator God? Aren't evolution and faith in God incompatible? Can a scientist believe in miracles like the resurrection?\n\nActually, I find no conflict here, and neither apparently do the 40 percent of working scientists who claim to be believers. Yes, evolution by descent from a common ancestor is clearly true. If there was any lingering doubt about the evidence from the fossil record, the study of DNA provides the strongest possible proof of our relatedness to all other living things.\n\nBut why couldn't this be God's plan for creation? True, this is incompatible with an ultra-literal interpretation of Genesis, but long before Darwin, there were many thoughtful interpreters like St. Augustine, who found it impossible to be exactly sure what the meaning of that amazing creation story was supposed to be. So attaching oneself to such literal interpretations in the face of compelling scientific evidence pointing to the ancient age of Earth and the relatedness of living things by evolution seems neither wise nor necessary for the believer.\n\nI have found there is a wonderful harmony in the complementary truths of science and faith. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. God can be found in the cathedral or in the laboratory. By investigating God's majestic and awesome creation, science can actually be a means of worship.\n\nWhat is your take on this commentary?

It is positively refreshing. A thinking person who recognizes the complementary relationship of faith in Jesus Christ and science! Thank you so much for making this article available.\n\nAlan Goldstein, Powder Springs, Georgia As is typical of believers, Collins was looking for answers, and when he didn't find them (or more likely didn't care for the answers he found), he turned to superstition. For example, what is the meaning of life? Science would say \"Life has no meaning, other than the meaning we give to it.\" I think this is a wonderful answer, and immensely preferable to, life exists because god was bored. And that our sole purpose for existence is to please god enough, so that we may enter heaven and sing his praises for all eternity.\n\nHyukwoo Shin, Del Mar, California It is no surprise to me that an accomplished scientist like Dr. Collins is a faithful believer because he asked himself the right questions. I see so many times atheists in science asking the wrong questions: \"Can you prove that the bible is true or that God does exist?\" The right questions are pointed out in this article: \"What is the meaning of life?\" \"Why am I here?\"\n\nJames Lampert, Fountain Valley, California The best case of all for the existence of a supreme being is in the very laws of physics: the fact that physics HAS laws, and that those laws are knowable, internally consistent, and elegant.\n\nBarbara Liang, Appleton, Wisconsin Dr. Collins stated that in his late 20s he made a leap of faith and embraced the Christian teachings because he could no longer live with \"uncertainties.\" An emotional quest for certainty and tranquility, no matter how beneficial to the individual, does not a factual system make. I am glad that Dr. Collins has the comfort of his beliefs, but his reasoning does not sound very scientific.\n\nJames Hastings, Franklin, Pennsylvania Thanks for publishing this point of view. I don't agree with the author, but it was refreshing to read commentary that was different from the conventional wisdom published ad nauseum. Maybe this sort of writing should appear more often than \"occasionally.\"\n\nJohn Borland, Waukegan, Illinois I am with Dr. Collins until he broaches the subject of Jesus. He poses questions about whether it is possible to reconcile Jesus' divinity with science, but he avoids answering them by devoting the remainder of the piece to evolution and the age of the earth. It seems to me that believing in Jesus, or any other divine prophet, requires an egocentric view of creation that goes far above and beyond Dr. Collins' argument for belief in God. To casually insert a reference to Jesus in this piece without addressing that issue seems to me to be an obvious attempt to blur the distinction. It makes the piece seem more like an advertisement for Christianity than a thoughtful discussion of spirituality.\n\nSuzanne Spinelli, Middlebury, Connecticut I agree with the scientist in the report, however, why is it only Judeo/Christian creation myth that can be 'real.' There are many different creation myths from the past until the present. I think it is offensive to negate all those other myths for the \"one true 'real'\" myth (depending on one's point of view). After all, who is to say which one is right? Could it be that they are all right in their own way?\n\nMara Alexander, Alexandria, Virginia With a Ph.D. in the social sciences, I'd find it more surprising that scientists don't believe in a god or organizing principle of some sort. What we pursue is \"truth,\" with the underlying belief that there is order in the universe if only we can discover it.

The Stone is featuring occasional posts by Gary Gutting, a professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, that apply critical thinking to information and events that have appeared in the news.\n\nThe Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers on issues both timely and timeless.\n\nOpposing sides in political debates often characterize one another as crazy, or a bit more politely, \u201cirrational.\u201d John McCain, for example, recently said that the view of opponents of the debt-limit increase was \u201cworse than foolish\u201d and \u201cbizzaro.\u201d Paul Krugman suggested that President Obama\u2019s desire to compromise on the debt-limit might be \u201cobsessive and compulsive.\u201d Even Elizabeth Drew, reporting on the debt-limit process, writes, \u201cWere they all insane? That\u2019s not a far-fetched question.\u201d In less vivid terms, the claim is typically that a rival group\u2019s thinking is dominated by a mind-muddling ideology that cannot be supported by rational argument. People are, of course, frequently irrational; they ignore obvious facts or make silly mistakes in reasoning. But the mere failure to support some of your basic claims with good logical arguments does not show that you are irrational. Any argument requires premises that it assumes and does not prove. We may construct a further argument for an unproven premise, but that argument will itself have unproven premises. That\u2019s why even mathematics, the most thoroughly rational enterprise we have, begins with unproven axioms.\n\nDoes it follow that all arguments are ultimately irrational? No, all that follows is that logicality (proof by logical argument) is not the same as rationality. There are ways of rationally accepting a claim that you can\u2019t prove by argument.\n\nPhilosophers \u2014 Descartes is usually the premier example \u2014 have sometimes thought that they could find first premises that would be totally obvious to any rational person; \u201cself-evident\u201d was one popular term for such premises. But it has become apparent that very few substantive claims (even in mathematics) can be established by valid arguments from totally obvious premises. We almost always need to start from assumptions that are controversial. These assumptions often correspond to what I like to call \u201cpictures\u201d \u2014 comprehensive views of \u201cthe lay of the land\u201d that guide our thinking on a given topic.\n\nConservatives, for example, see business as primarily a source of social and economic good, achieved by the market mechanism of seeking to maximize profit. They therefore think government\u2019s primary duty regarding businesses is to see that they are free to pursue their goal of maximizing profit. Liberals, on the other hand, think that the effort to maximize profit threatens at least as much as it contributes to our societies\u2019 well-being. They therefore think that government\u2019s primary duty regarding businesses is to protect citizens against business malpractice.\n\nOf course, conservatives admit that sometimes business practices need government regulation and liberals admit that sometimes regulation is a bad idea, but in each case these are exceptions to their basic picture. While conservatives are (as Ronald Reagan put it) terrified at the words, \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help you,\u201d liberals are terrified at the words, \u201cI\u2019m from [for example] the cable company and I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d\n\nHardly anyone holds either of these rival pictures as the result of a compelling logical argument. Pictures come to have a hold on us from a complex mixture of family influences, schooling, personal experiences, discussions with friends, reading newspapers and blogs, and more. Arguments may play a role, but they are not decisive and we simply come to feel convinced of a particular picture. Apart from clearly pathological cases, there\u2019s nothing inappropriate or irrational about this process. It\u2019s the way almost everyone forms basic convictions about serious matters, including not just politics but also morality and religion.\n\nBut although accepting one of these rival pictures is not irrational, inflexible adherence to it can be. Neither picture would be viable without an exception-clause that acknowledges a certain validity to the rival picture. When an issue about regulation comes up, it\u2019s entirely appropriate (and rational) for liberals and conservatives to begin with an inclination to the response generally favored by their picture. But both sides need to attend to the specific facts of the situation at hand and take seriously the possibility that these facts give reason for invoking the exception-clause in their picture. (For example: The risk from that nuclear plant is too big to take for the sake of free market principles, or the severity of our unemployment makes it worthwhile to exempt small businesses from some record-keeping regulations.) When liberals or conservatives become incapable of thinking this way, their positions become irrational.\n\nMy point can also be helpfully expressed in some terminology due to Aristotle. Sophia (roughly, theoretical knowledge), he says, grasps universal truths, whereas phronesis (roughly, good practical judgment) is required to properly apply these truths to particular instances. Although Aristotle might disapprove, we members of a deeply pluralistic society need to admit the availability of diverse, even conflicting sources of sophia \u2014 the rival pictures I\u2019ve been talking about. Discussions about the theoretical truth of pictures are important, but of little immediate value in the trenches of practical policy-making.\n\nPolicy-making does, however require Aristotelian phronesis, particularly in the form of an ability to recognize salient facts that require invoking the exception-clause of a guiding picture. When participants in a political dispute show themselves to lack phronesis, then we are entitled to judge them irrational.\n\nI leave readers with the exercise of applying this analysis in their own ways to the recent debt-limit debate."], "summary": ["Our recent political fights show that there are ways of rationally accepting a claim that you can't prove by argument."]}, {"title": ["How to defeat al-Qaeda"], "text": ["Here's the thing about extremists: their strategy is transparent.\n\nThink about this. The most high-profile terrorist attacks of the past few years have occurred on Thanksgiving (the Mumbai murders) and Christmas (the Amsterdam flight attempt).\n\nExtremist groups are well aware that on those two days large numbers of Americans are home with their families. The TV is most likely on, and when the news anchor interrupts the football game with \"Breaking News\", there are a dozen people in the living rooms of tens of millions of households listening to the report about \"Muslim extremists attack luxury hotel / transatlantic flight.\"\n\nA disturbing theme in the recent spate of terrorist suspects is that these people seem highly integrated. \"I never observed any extreme behavior from them,\" said the mosque youth group leader of five Virginia Muslims arrested in Pakistan for allegedly plotting against the United States. \"There were no signs of anything extreme at all when I met him,\" said a university acquaintance of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.\n\nAnd just like everything else extremists do, there is a strategy here. There are certainly more than enough poor young Muslims brainwashed to become suicide bombers. Why take the time to recruit, train and deploy an upper-class Nigerian student in London? First of all, the shock value generates significantly more media coverage. And even more important, the deliberate use of unlikely attackers creates an irrational fear and distrust of all Muslims. The thinking goes something like this: \"If this upper class, seemingly well-integrated Muslim can be a terrorist, what about my Muslim neighbor/doctor/coworker?\"\n\nThat kind of irrational fear leads to letters like the one a retired airline pilot from Boca Raton, Fla., published in the Jan. 4 USA Today. He proposed that all Muslims and Middle Easterners be banned from airplanes until terrorism ends. \"Let these people deal with their own ...\" he wrote. (See my piece in USA Today on same topic.)\n\nFear leads to prejudice. Prejudice increases alienation. Alienation allows al-Qaeda to whisper in the ears of the off-the-cliff few: \"The West hates your people and disrespects your faith. Join us at this training camp to learn how to be a true Muslim.\"\n\nThe leaders of that training camp keep a sharp eye on their recruits, they select the ones who appear most integrated into the West and therefore most shocking to Westerners, they circle a date on the calendar when the TV's are on and the families are gathered. Sometimes they get their boom, but all the time they'll get their much-desired media coverage. Which enhances fear, which increases prejudice, which leads to ... the pattern is so depressingly obvious.\n\nLet's remember this: extremists have failed on every substantive front. They have not roused millions of the faithful to their cause. (If Osama bin Laden could raise an army, he would. It is precisely because he can't that he has to rely on a shadowy network using the tools of terrorism, which is to say the tactic of fear.) They have not communicated a vision that large groups of people embrace. They have not built a society that people want to live in. They have only been successful at manipulation.\n\nDefeating terrorism will require many things - destroying actual terrorist cells, improving airport security, remaining vigilant. But we can all take one crucial step starting now: stop letting ourselves be manipulated.\n\nBy Eboo Patel | January 6, 2010; 9:32 AM ET | Category: Interfaith Issues , Religion & Politics , Religious Conflict Save & Share: Previous: Oral Roberts at a bar mitzvah | Next: Evangelicals for pluralism\n\nIt is a common mistake by non muslim nations to examine the muslim violence in their own national context.A global context should be extrapolated to draw a broader consensus.

Muslim terrorism is a global cancer and single explanation like israel as the root cause of terrorism is a joke. Muslims like violence in all spheres of their lives.Firstly with their women being oppressed and their daughters and sisters subjected to honor killings. Once the family members are terrorised to submission, then they extend the peace (sic)in the local community to all muslims by exterminating the liberal muslims and few good natured souls. Finally, they wipe out non muslim minority by sustained persecution and then, finally, export terror out of country. So folks, remember, no quick fix here. Now europe is under seize with these genteel men demanding right to change the european culture. once accomplished that goal, the eyes are set on americas.\n\nAbolish immigration of muslimsas as a starting point and encourage only non muslims to migrate.

It is not a book for the muslims only. The basics of Quran remain relevant as universal truths. What change you see, when one believes in the 7th century that God is one and Muhammad PBUH is his prophet and the same thing is believed by the 1.5 billion muslims on the face of this earth today?. What wrong do you see in practicing a charity of 2.5% on the accumulated wealth then and now?. What pain it give to the others when muslims fasts for 30 days in a year as they use to fast in the \"7th century\".Quran prohibits gambling, alcohol, interest and codify many social issues which elevate a person from the bottom of ignorance to the honor of the best creation of Allah. Do you think these thing are irrelevant today?.\n\nYou wrote: People then used to believe that the semen and prostatic fluids originated much higher in the body than they do now.\"\n\nScholars have commented on them differently. You have acknowledged the limits of knowledge but still you think what you know is ultimate.I can add my own views in this matter is, that the whole trunk and the mind is involved in this process through they are produced in testes. Maududi writes: 3\"Sulb\" is the backbone and \"tara'ib\"the breast- bones, i.e. the ribs. Since the procreative fluid in both man and woman is discharged from that part of the body which is between the back and the breast, it is said that man has been created from the fluid issuing out froth between the back and the breast. This fluid is produced even in case the hands and feet are cut off. Therefore, it is not correct to say that it issues out from the whole body of man. In fact, the principal organs of the body are its source and all these are located in the trunk. The brain has not been mentioned separately because the back-bone is that part of the brain through which connection between the body and the brain is established\". The real matter is in what context this is mentioned and that is the Existence of Allah Almighty.\n\nPosted by: hitman2 | January 15, 2010 3:59 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nThe examples you bring up are all that the thinkers of the 9th and 10th century brought up. They have been discussed and understood. The world has moved onto the 21st century. Unfortunately, for everyone, the muslims are mired in about the 9th century. Yes you are a believer and you are most welcome to it. The Quran is book of the 7th century and it reflects the knowledge of that century. And it has been shown to be incorrect. People then used to believe that the semen and prostatic fluids originated much higher in the body than they do now. Allah obviously did not know and stated the knowledge of the physicians of that time. It is as simple as that. You can believe what ever you like but do not expect other people to believe the nonsense with you. Quran is filled with nonsense and if it was so easy to understand why is it so easily misunderstood. Why is it that Al-Qaeda and the head chopping muslims around the world quote it to justfy their violence? Again you are welcome to believe that the quran is the literal word of the all powerful and all knowing God, but do all other people to what they choose to believe especially in their own lands. But then you quote Mawdudi who said and you quoted that the non-muslims (Kaafirs) spread mischeif on this earth and hence should not be allowed to even rule themselves.

Also religion do not expect that a common man should know logic,reasoning, rational and irrational. All that is needed, is simple \"common sense\". As I have said earlier, Quran is not a book to teach science or arts.It is meant for all mankind hence it is simple and can be understood even by a person with simple common sense. You have not answered my questions: \"Can you tell me what are the parameters of your \"rationality\"?

And when a piece of iron is placed into the fire, after sometimes it takes the shape of the fire, then you cannot distinguish between fire and the iron. such is the case of a true believer and his belief.

Is this the place to learn philosophy? I do not think so, but I will give you a simple \"common sense\" answer to your question about the chair.\n\nThe chair does not exist before it is made by the carpenter. The concept of the chair existed. The design of the chair existed. Just as the finished chair does not spring into its final configuration but does so over time. Similarly the concept does not arise instantaneously and nor does the design. They go through iterations. If you look at the work of any artisan who creates new deigns you can see the progression of their work. It is silly to confuse the material finished chair with its initial material components or with its initial hazy concept or with its design.\n\nMan does not know many a things. Most likely the laws and facts that we do not know far exceed the little we do know. It is far more honest to say \"I don't know\" than to buy into fairy tales invented by our ancestors among others and to enforce them as true knowledge. The entire enterprise of science is built upon figuring out, discovering, and tackling questions at the boundary of what we do know and what we don't.\n\nPosted by: AKafir | January 13, 2010 4:23 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nSo you hide many a things! okay this your discrition.\n\nCan you tell me what are the parameters of your \"rationality\"?

In this freedom lies man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real trial; his knowledge, his wisdom, his power of discrimination, and his freedom of will and action are all being tried and tested. In this trial and test man has not been obliged to adopt any particular course, for by compulsion the very object of the trial would have been defeated. Evidently if in an examination you are compelled to write a certain answer to a question, the examination will be of no use. Your merit can be properly judged only if you are allowed to answer the questions freely, according to your own knowledge and understanding. If your answer is correct you will succeed, and will get access to future progress; and if your answer is wrong, you will fail, and your failure will bar the way to further progress. Similar is the situation which man faces in the world.

Now, on the one hand, there is a man who under-stands neither his own nature nor that of the universe. He errs in recognizing his real Master and in knowing His attributes, and misuses his freedom by pursuing the path of disobedience and revolt. such a man has failed in the trial of his knowledge, intelligence, and duty-consciousness.

If the reader keeps these three basic things in mind, he will find that in this Book there is no incongruity in the style, no gap in the continuity of the subject and no lack of interconnection between its various topics. As a matter of fact, this Book is not irrelevant anywhere with regard to is Subject, its Central Theme and its Aim. From its very beginning to its end, the different topics it deals with are so intimately connected with its Central Theme that they may be likened to the beautiful gems of the same necklace, despite their different colours and sizes. The Qur'an keeps the same object in view, whether it is relating the story of the creation of the earth or of the Heavens or of man or is referring to the manifestations in the universe or stating events from human history. As the aim of the Qur'an is to guide man and not to teach nature study or history or philosophy or any other science or art, it does not concern itself with these latter subjects. The only thing with which it is concerned is to expound the Reality, to remove misunderstandings and misconceptions about it, to impress the Truth upon the minds, to warn them of the consequences of wrong attitudes and to invite humanity to the Right Way. The same is true of the criticism of the creeds, of the moral systems, of the deeds of men and communities and of its disussions of the problems of metaphysics etc. That is why it states or discusses or cites a thing only to the extent relevant to its aims and objects and leaves out unnecessary and irrelevant details and turns over and over again to its Central Theme and to its invitation round which every other topic revolves. When the Qur'an is studied in this light, no doubt is left that the whole of it is a closely reasoned argument and there is continuity of subject throughout the Book.\n\nPosted by: hitman2 | January 13, 2010 3:08 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nYour rationality seems to fell sick.

PourING, FlowING FORCEFULLY. Allah is talking about the water in an adult and not developmentally. The water \"Emerges\" or \"Appears\". Note the tense. Do you know Arabic. See the tense in the Arabic.\n\nDevelopementally? The words do not even remotely imply a location years in the past. Developmentally is as lame a justification as muslims can find. Developmentally the testes start between the ribs and the spine. Do you realise how silly and how absurd these justifications appear to one who examine with a clear logic. This is the song and dance of morons like Zakir Naik. And the site of nourishment and blood supply notion is beyond silliness. That is a sign of simple desperation to support a silly argument.\n\nYou show why it is going to be nearly impossible for the believers of the Quran to escape the irrationality of the 7th century mind.

Of course in an adult person the testis are not situated in between the back bone and chest bone but these have an embryological relation (developmental) to a site which is situated \"in between the back bone and ribs\": According to the research done in the field of Embryology (science of human development) the pair of testis which produce seminal fluid, start developing at lumber region, during intrauterine life i.e. the time when the child is in the womb of mother. This area is exactly in-between the backbone and the ribs. Latter on as child develops the testis descends down and before the time the child is born, the testis has descended to scrotum (coverings around the testis). But their control i.e. the nerve supply remains at the same lumber region through out the life of the person. Further to say whenever there is any injury inflicted to that region, the sexual act is lost. Secondly the nourishment for the testis i.e. the blood supply also come from the same lumber region through out the life of a person, that to if hampered at any time results into loss of the function of the testis. Meaning there by although the testis descend down but their control and nourishment remain at a site which is \"in-between the back bone and ribs.

Allah is a strange deity indeed who curses the majority of his own creation (Kaafir are 80% of humanity still), and who promises to eternally torture in the most horrible of manner all the kaafirs. Not only that he admits as you have quoted that he \"seals the hearts, and ears, and covers the eyes\" of the Kaafirs so they cannot but be Kaafirs, and he can mislead because he has absolute power over them.

This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear Allah.\n\n3. Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;\n\n4.

Ask not questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble. But if ye ask about things when the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made plain to you, Allah will forgive those: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing.\n\n005.102 YUSUFALI: Some people before you did ask such questions, and on that account lost their faith.\n\nYou can read all the tafsirs on these verses and it amounts to firstly the eternal question that no one has answered unambiguously \"What is the proof that Allah even exists?\". That question is being asked even today and there is no satisfactory answer except the believers cite their faith. All the believers of all the dead Gods have always cited thei r faith in their Gods. The last two verses are particular to Islam where believers are specifically told not to question the rules and laws of Allah. Allah wanted humans to pray 50 times a day and it is only the intervention of the Nabi that \"burden\" was reduced to five times a day. Think for a second what the verses imply and think on the implication of what examples the Tafseers use to explain the verses!!! Simply th e believers are discouraged to question the Quran in any real meaningful way for they may get in trouble with Allah.\n\nAs far as the scientific spirit was born as a result of the imperitive by the Quran, and the inductive method blossomed among the Arabs first is a canard that is taught to the muslims by their elders. It has very little basis in fact. A lot of the scientific method cited for the Muslim scientists turns out to be translations of earlier works which were not credited to the original authors. Example: Arabic nuemerals were from south indian hindu mathematicians and the zero (or the arabic zarra) was also the invention of the hindus. Similarly, much of Al-jabr's work, or the optics of Al-Haytham is known to contain earlier works without due credit being given to the original authors. That is not to say that Aljabr or AlHaytham did not contribute to their field of science. They did. As an aside, all ancient scientist that originate in the lands ruled by the muslims now are referred to as \"muslim\" scientists although it is not clear in many cases whether they were muslims or not. Many lived in fear of their lives as heretics and \"Kaafirs\". Example there is still argument on whether Haytham was a muslim arab or a magi persian.\n\nBut I do agree with you that a believer is different from a non-believer.

Most of the world's religions say to use observation and deduction to understand the creation. Most of the world's religions use the personal relationship of God as more important than a book or a savior or a prophet. Most of the world's religions consider scientific reasoning, empirical spirituality, personal empiricial exercises, skepticism towards self cognition, as a normal part of the spiritual process.\n\nThe idea of mono-ideology is that this is not the case. These religions believe that truth can only be known in the church or the umma. The minority of the world's religions believe this. But it is a powerful tool for building alliances and oppressive militaries, crusades, jihads, etc thus it serves the purposes of the powerful well to create such superstition. In the meanwhile, the other world religions get maligned and thus those people who would be seeking for the Truth as God stop. The failure on the spiritual level of mono-ideology is that it stops rational, intelligent, brilliant humanity from even trying to see the supreme reality.

About 13% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the largest Muslim country,[9] 31% in the Indian Subcontinent,[9] and 20% in Arab countries.[10] Converts and immigrant communities are found in almost every part of the world. With 1.57 billion Muslims[11] (see Islam by country), Islam is the second-largest religion in the world and arguably the fastest growing religion in the world.\n\nPosted by: hitman2 | January 9, 2010 4:30 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nConverts invoke several reasons for embracing Islam: that, unlike Christianity, it makes sense to them; that Islam is commensurate with modern science; that Islam is an egalitarian religion, blind to the racial prejudices so common to Western culture; and that one betters himself upon embracing Islam, doing away with adverse personal and social behavior. In some narratives, a rather more emotional attitude is suggested, depicting a defining metaphysical moment of peace and understanding in which Islam was embraced; in some, this emotional attitude is preconditioned with a logical acceptance of Islam's truthfulness. Many of these may sound doubtful to those not susceptible to conversion or familiar with the nuances of Islam, but they nonetheless illustrate the view which Islamists wish to convey.\n\nOne notion suggested directly or implied by almost all narrators is the complete transformation Islam brought about in their lives. Where there was a void, Islam brought meaning; where there was disorder, Islam brought harmony; where there was despair, Islam brought hope. After embracing Islam, all hesitation and confusion faded away. Each found peace with himself, with his surroundings, and with God.\n\nIn \"Why I Came to Islam?\" Susie Brackenborough advances as an ultimate proof for Islam's truth that the Qur'an prefigured science in discoveries made by scientists only hundreds of years later. She suggests: \"These 'miracles' have been discovered by scientists (such as the study of embryology) and explorers (such as the world is indeed round and not flat) many years after the revelation, and many more miracles are still to be found as our society develops and progresses.\"\n\nPosted by: hitman2 | January 9, 2010 4:09 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nFirst, Eboo tries to perpetuate the myth that the terrorists and suicide bombers prey on poor Muslims. How many middle or upper-class Muslims with graduate degrees have to blow themselves up before the Muslim apologists stop this tired tactic of blaming terrorism on some kind of economic status. I have read the book: Islam is the problem, not economics.\n\nAnd to address the question of fear leading to prejudice. While this is possible, this logic is misleading. Fear can also lead to caution and prudence and avoiding that which is dangerous. I have a fear of falling from heights so I stay safely away from the ledge. I have a fear of driving my car too fast so I keep it under control. I have a fear of people who think they have the ultimate truth and feel that everyone should either become one of them, accept submission to their rule, or be attacked and killed. My fear prevents me from doing something foolish and dangerous. I act according to fear in order to be safe. Fear can be good. Your analysis of fear leading to prejudice should be restated as an irrational fear of people that has no reasonable basis in fact or experience. Fearing people who ascribe to the ideology presented in the Quran and Hadith is not irrational. Not all prejudice is bad. I am prejudiced against neo-Nazis and Islamists because they espouse a view of life and how to treat others that I find abhorrent and which they center their lives around. While fear should not completely control us and prevent us from living a full life, it is necessary for survival. Don't underestimate the positive value of rational fear.\n\nPosted by: rentianxiang | January 8, 2010 12:27 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nThere is good news for you all: Muslims love to kill Muslims.

But they won't denounce the hatred in the koran. What does that represent but duplicitous nonsense. They say we should not attack muslims, but that we should expect muslims to attack us if we do something wrong. Well then, all the arabic non-muslims should do what the muslims do: riot, burn effigies of mohamed, draw pictures depicting mohamed having sex with his multiple wives, break the kabaa idol, replace the mosques with churches and temples...

So should Hindus drive armies into pakistan, afghanistan, iran, and armenians send genocidal hordes into turkey, jews buy and launch rockets into the west bank, or sudanese rape and kill north sudanese...\n\nWhy can't a muslim say, when hate is taught, whether it is the koran, the bible, or any other so called scripture, that scripture should be edited? Because they are so brain washed that they don't see general principles, they see tribal power and worship it. Atheists, secularists, the vast majority of Hindus, even a greater majority of buddhits, and so the Hope,the Navajo, the Pagans, etc can see that wherever hate is taught it is wrong. This is not beyond the human mind. It is beyond the mono-ideologist.\n\nThey have to believe their book is perfect or they realize that the emperor has no clothes.\n\nIs there a muslim who is willing to stand up and say, when the koran hates, it is wrong? that is the muslim who can bring peace to the islamic world. (currently it is mostly muslims killing muslims, thus to get peace I suppose the particle morality is that they continue their suicide - just to be clear I believe in the principle of freedom of conscience; when a hindu kills to defend god, s/he is full of nonsense and if he finds a book that says he should, I would be willing to denounce that book; do you have that courage?)\n\nPosted by: Navin1 | January 8, 2010 11:35 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nI am wondering what brand of crack you guys are doing.

Chairman Pedophile Arafat, whose repulsive pedophilia was well known to reporters and the entire Middle East, agreed to the ridiculous Peace Plan.\n\nHeavily Christian US, along with predominantly Christian New York, believed him. However, when his thugs fired at Ariel Sharon on the Temple Mount/Dome of the Rock, beginning an Intifada, what many had been trying to tell the Israeli people finally sank in.\n\nThe Saudis, whom I do not often quote, remarked, \"The Palestinians never lose an opportunity to lose an opportunity.\"\n\nHeavily Christian America, like your heavily Christian self, did not bat an eyelash as Israel negotiated with Chairman Pedophile Arafat while sustaining weekly and sometimes twice-weekly terror attacks. Again and again, Ehud Barak proclaimed that the \"Peace Process\" would not be derailed by terrorists. However, Chairman Pedophile had always been a terrorist, just as he'd always been a Pedophile, with a strong preference for blond boys, one or two always at his side. (Israelis, among others, don't much like this sort of thing.)\n\nIndeed, Chairman Pedophile, while addressing the United Nations some decades prior simultaneously blew up a school bus loaded with little girls and boys in Israel.\n\nAfter the last ridiculous fiasco, pretending that this Nobel Prize winning pedophile terrorist was a statesman, this position forced on Israel by the heavily Christian United States, left-leaning Israel, finally, after four wars, endless terrorist attacks, swung to the right.\n\nFor two thousand years, heavily Christian American, Jews have prayed facing the Temple Mount, three times daily, facing the Temple Mount.

Christian factions engaged in centuries of bloody internal warfare across Europe. Religion has no monopoly on the entitlement action. Pseudo-Scientific movements like communism and fascism have proved to be at least as destructive to human life. The problem with Islam is that it is happening now and it is happening to us.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution engendered an enduring respect for the rights of the individual, adjunct to a movement that was already beginning to flower in western Europe. This has served as a suppression agent on most religious passion. The material wealth of these nations is the empirical proof of the movements efficacy.\n\nThe Islamic radicals reject this ethos, but the huge gap in material wealth of western nations compared to Islamic dominated ones creates a problem for their ideology. The rise of modern terrorism is in some way based on the need to explain why those who God should favor be so poor. Real grievances with western nations are blown completely out of proportion and are used as an excuse for failed economic development.\n\nPosted by: SCKershaw | January 7, 2010 10:53 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nTo Capn Ahab Turkey began a crackdown on Islamic fundamentalism in the 1920s, long before there was an Israel, or dissatisfaction over the rule of the Saudi royal family and Gulf sheikdoms. That's because Kemal Ataturk recognized that there was something basically wrong with the Salafist formula of Islam. As a result, Turkey is now a secular democracy, after many decades of cultural evolution. But when the Baathist party tried much the same formula in Egypt, Syria and Iraq begining in the 1950s, they were demonized because of their stance against Israel, so the type of societal evolution away from Islamic fundamentalism that the Baathists espoused never took hold. That's one of the many frustrations of people in the Middle East who feel that the natural evolution of their societies has been unfavorably altered by the encounter of Islamic peoples with Western Europe, Israel and the United States in the 20th century. This is what fuels the return to fundamentalism in many areas of the Muslim world. A Middle East peace agreement between Israel and its Arab neighbors would go a long way toward turning down the temperature inside the pressure cooker. Most Arabs are willing to adopt a land-for-peace formula based on a return to 1967 borders, or something close to it. What most media outlets do not disclose is that in the Camp David discussions of 2000, the US insisited that the Palestinians accept the idea that Jews living inside what would become Arab East Jerusalem would continue to be under Israeli law. That was a ridiculous position, and it's no wonder that Arafat could not accept it. The fact that the US could propose such a thing with a straight face shows the depth of pro-Israel bias in the Clinton Administration. And yet Arafat was demonized for not doing so. All because Clinton lacked the statesmanship to go on American TV and demand that Israel back down on this one condition. Which he probably didn't do because his wife might have lost her election to be a Senator in heavily-Jewish New York. This is why many people who actually know the facts of this situation are upset with Israel. We give Israel billions of dollars of aid every year, and when we ask them to make peace, they spit in our faces. And yes, all of this does in fact make Islamic terrorism much, much worse than it might otherwise be. And our traitorous Congressmen back them up, rather than cutting off funding in order to apply pressure like James Baker and the first President Bush did.

Instead of destroying Islam and the countries from which their violence against us originates, as our parents did with Japan and Germany, we pretend to believe this nonsense about Islam being a religion of peace, and let the corrupt, criminal dictatorships off the hook.\n\nLevel Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran. Forget humanity, treat them with the same violence our parents doled out to Japan and Germany and Italy during WW2 and this \"war\" would be over. Make those countries REALLY suffer, reduce their populations, make them fear us, and no other Mid Eastern country would allow these Islamic mutts to set up shop ever again.\n\nI love the complaint that this \"war\" on terror is taking longer than WW2. If WE, this generation, had fought this war like our parents fought WW2, it would have been over in 6 months and the rest of the Islamic countries would be bowing and scraping in order not to be next. But the U.S. is soft, Islam knows it, and this will not change. Islam is a stain. The rest of the world won't miss it. Make the rest of the world fear to BE Islamic and Islam would shed it's weird and violent strictures against women and non-Islamics and the problem would be instantly solved.\n\nI'll especially not hold my breath while an Islamist resides in the White House and all but cheers for Islamic extremist acts.\n\nPosted by: JamesChristian | January 7, 2010 4:36 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nSorry Patel, but when you have 30% of Muslims in the UK saying Sharia law should be imposed there, or 90+% who believe that Israel and the Jews should be destroyed, I think a little bit of concern is in order.\n\nMuslims need to get their house in order first.

Terrorists are not an organized entity that can be wiped out or depleted to a small number. The end of terrorism is the end of mono-ideological thinking that says I can target civiliams, so as to increase suffering, so that I can have the world the way I want it. The difference between a just war construct and terrorism is the end goal - increase human freedom, increase group power. The tactical difference between drones, planes, etc is that the tactic is designed to kill an enemy while the terrorist is designed to kill an innocent to send a message to the enemy.\n\nIf the koran is to be interpreted as saying that you should not kill civilians, and terrorists are choosing to kill civilians (volleyball players and college kids) (note this is not collateral damage but the target itself) then the muslims should conclude this is the act of non-muslims (infidels) and fatwas should be declared that the unbeliever al qaeda terrorists are attacking islam and thus muslims have the right to kill these people.\n\nBut the funding for the terrorists comes from the muslim community. Thus, at least to that substantial amount, there is support within the islamic community to kill innocent volley ball players. Then how can they declare a fatwa against those who support the terrorists as they are the supporters.\n\nTo defeat terrorists, kill them. To defeat their supporters, kill them or freeze their bank accounts. To defeat terrorism destroy mono-ideological constructs that say the one and true god hates ______ (insert your favorite infidel group) people. Whether it is the koran, bible, or any other book that says god hates the non-believer, let that be disavowed by the good people of the world and such teaching be called universally evil.\n\nIs Eboo ready to say that when the koran says god hates infidels it is wrong. Is Eboo ready for ending terrorism?\n\nPosted by: Navin1 | January 7, 2010 3:53 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nTo Eboo Patel: \"They have not roused millions of the faithful to their cause.\" Wrong. They have been able to recruit enough fighters and supporters to keep fighting the militarily superior Soviets and now the far more militarily superior USA in Iraq Afghan, Paks and Yemen for years to come. They don't need an army such as Saddam's that are easily defeated by USA. \"They have not communicated a vision that large groups of people embrace. They have not built a society that people want to live in\". Wrong. Their vision is not totally rejected or detested in the Arab world.

Muslims are just as guilty of this as Christians, Jews and every other extremist group in the world.

A classic example is the murder of a poetess, Asma bint Marwan, on the orders of Muhammad. Marwan had exposed Muhammad as a fraud and wrote poems criticizing the thug. Moe was disturbed by her writings and ordered her murdered.\n\n\"When the apostle heard what she had said he said, \"Who will rid me of Marwan's daughter?\" `Umayr b. `Adiy al-Khatmi who was with him heard him, and that very night he went to her house and killed her. In the morning he came to the apostle and told him what he had done and he [Muhammad] said, \"You have helped God and His apostle, O `Umayr!\" When he asked if he would have to bear any evil consequences the apostle said, \"Two goats won't butt their heads about her\", so `Umayr went back to his people.\"\n\nAsma was killed while she was asleep with her infants.

They are descendents of the Canaanites, Ammonites, Arameans, Babylonians, Copts etc. who were overran by the Arabs. Those people had adopted the Arab language and basic culture and most, not all, the invaders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 religion. There are still large Christian minorities in Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. Many of those minorities have emigrated to North and South America and Australia, starting in the late 19th Century. They comprise the vast majority of the immigrant Arabised people. That means that not every person with an Arab sounding name is a Muslim. This segment of western population distinguishes itself in many ways; the most is their extreme allegiance to their adopted countries. The West needs to be aware of this very vital fact.\n\nPosted by: abhab1 | January 7, 2010 12:02 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nBesides the Hindu terrorists from the well-established training camps in India under the saffronazis, other Hindu mercenaries too are active all over from Ayodhya to Kashmir. The infamous comment made by Lal Kishenchand Advani, the ex-Home Minister of the expired BJP-led NDA government, that Bajrangis being terrorists is a joke, only spurred the brutes of Bajrang Dal in their crime spree. Dara Singh, a Bajrangi, had successfully terrorized Orissa by burning alive Pastor Graham Staines and his two sons.\n\nAdvani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clean chit to the Dal in the wake of this heinous crime made him look more an ogre than a sentient human. George Fernandes, the then Defense Minister, had called it a foreign conspiracy, not a Hindutva crime. That Hindu terrorists have been the backbone of RSS-VHP-BJP-Bajrang Dal, the communal fascist combine, has been evidenced time and time again. Its so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrishul-dikshas\u00e2\u0080\u009d (knife distribution) are naked and subversive paramilitary training camps for its militias. Not only are the enlistees given their arms and training but also incantatory lessons in hate and violence against minorities, who, they are told, have to be bloodily extirpated, in order for the land exclusively to belong to Hindus.\n\nThis climate of sacred savagery spawned by the saffronazis has successfully spread the miasma of bigoted violence all over. The abundance of firearms freely made available to the HinduTaliban gangsters empowers the anti-socials and prods them to \u00e2\u0080\u009caction\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This is an investment towards routine training in ethnic cleansing and eventually establishing Hindu Rashtra, envisaged by Savarkar and Golwalkar, the prime mentors of assassins, arsonists, thugs and rapists \u00e2\u0080\u009cserving the cause of Hindutva\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nA glimpse of the climate of Hindu crimes rampant is in order. An article, titled Gujarat 2002 Visits Gohana [Haryana] by Shamsul Islam (Milli Gazette, 16-30 Sep. 05, p.8, New Delhi) lays out \u00e2\u0080\u009cSimilarities with Gujarat 2002 Carnage\u00e2\u0080\u009d:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cDalit houses and properties were burnt by releasing gas from cylinders. Big and well constructed houses were both looted and burnt whereas smaller houses were only looted. The arsonists carried away moveable properties in carts they had brought with them to transport their booty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Police and law and order machinery stood as mock spectators. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Only Dalit properties were targeted. If there happened to be a non-Dalit property, it was spared, which means the attackers had full knowledge of the identities of the home-owners. For instance, in Arya Nagar which has mixed population, only Dalit houses were blasted. Likewise, at Samta Chowk market (adjacent to Balmiki Basti), out of around 20 shops only a junk-dealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop owned by a Dalit was looted and completely burnt.\n\nPosted by: hitman2 | January 7, 2010 12:01 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\nEboo, you don't get it.

Write to the leaders or to the newspapers or to the imams or mullahs in Islamic countries and tell them that the whole civilized world is against their violent cult.

Syria into a confessional Lebanon, a shrunk new syria, trans-Jordan and where Britain colluded with jews to slice off Palestine from G Syria and present it on a silver plate to them and create an alien jewish entity (Balfour Declaration of 1917) by explleing 70% of the indigenous Palestinians in 1947/8(now six million refugees)and occupying five million more in historic PAlestine for the past 61 years.The Khost bomber is the son of a Palestinian refugee.\n\nPalestine is the mother of all problems:US blind support for \"isrl\" is at the heart of the present hostility and the major feeder of terrroism. Only the blind and the dumb will pretend that the Palestine question does not exist.\n\nThe Bush/Cheney/isrl war of choice on Iraq is another festering grievance-as well as the war on Afghanistan which so far failed to catch ben laden and co.Instead of finding ben laden and serving him with justice he deserves,Bush went to war whose victims are essentially the Afghan people and not Al Qaedah.\n\nAnother on going grievance is the US support and nurturing for Muslim/Arab despots and dictators:for example it's well known that radiacal Egyptian islamist movements were born in Egypt's horrendous jails and as a result of the torture of political opposition who were jailed because of political opinion.\n\nThe US along with major European powers-Britain, France and Germany-should look the facts in the face and confornt and resolve these grievances which are the perfect fodder for terrorism.\n\nPrior to the anamoalous craetion of the racist apartheid militaristic jewish ethno-religious colonial entity,there were no PLO,no HAMAS,no Hezballa and-not even Al Qaeada.\n\nThe US should deal with the root causes and then engage in public diplomacy:it is hard to sell spoiled eggs no matter how hard you try.\n\nPosted by: asizk | January 7, 2010 10:05 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\n\"Fear leads to prejudice.

Muslims always cry hoarse if they are discriminated at airports and immigration centers for terrorist acts from their own co-religionists.

But Eboo cheekily responds elsewhere:\n\n\"(If Osama bin Laden could raise an army, he would. It is precisely because he can't that he has to rely on a shadowy network using the tools of terrorism, which is to say the tactic of fear.)\"\n\nWell, Osama bin Laden has shown already that aszymmetric warfare wins him and the radical Islamic ideologies everything. He need NOT raise an army to win this Jihad against the West. He already is very effective and has achieved his cult-like status. Killing (decapitation/suicide bombings) of western civilians is the most effective way of getting political mileage which is what bin Laden getting. He is freely able to recruit suicide bombers and terrorists to cause mayhem. So, what is the need for an army, Eboo ?\n\nNow at this point Eboo Patel and his hypocritical fans would say that \"Quran does not permit killing of innocents, so dumping Osama and all other Muslims in the same group is unfair because Islam means peace.\"\n\nSuch babble doesn't do any good. Those innocent civilians who have been killed by Muslim terrorists will not not come back not matter how much Eboo Patel blabbers ou his good faith senses. Actually people like Eboo are causing more harm to the war on Islamic terrorism (aka \"Man Made Disaster\") than helping others. In fact, Eboo and his Muslim folks need to be ostracized from flying.

It then expects the general public to put pressure on its government to withdraw from the fight. On the other hand western armies do their best to protect non-combatant Muslims in Muslim countries. If the West deliberately killed a few more Muslim civilians then these Muslims will pressure their governments to eradicate AQ. Also AQ has widespread sympathies among the general Muslim population.\n\n2. The West refuses to implement the most effective measure to minimize terrorism at home. That is to stop all immigration and visitors from approximately 10 Muslim countries that have know terrorist organization and these organization get support form the national governments as in Pakistan where the army and ISI are hand in glove with AQ and the Taliban. If the West stopped all immigrants from the countries listed below the chances of terrorist attacks will decrease by nearly 100%.

Should not the vast majority of \"good\" Muslims be taking care of this problem? Yes, but they do not. Why? The answer is simple: In the Muslim world the concept does not exist of aiding and abetting a crime. Muslims feel there is no contradiction between saying they are not terrorists and do not support them while a terrorist cell exists down the street and everyone knows of it. Muslims have no concept as in the U.S. that knowing anything about a crime, remaining silent in the face of knowledge of a criminal, is a crime itself. The truth is the way Westerners are being manipulated is to believe that Muslims see the world in the same way as Westerners. They do not. If they are not planting bombs they are silent in the face of those that do. Again, if most Muslims really were innocent then terrorists would not even have a chance of existing in Muslim society. But they do exist. Will continue to exist. Because the \"good\" Muslims do nothing.\n\nPosted by: daniel12 | January 7, 2010 7:34 AM Report Offensive Comment\n\nThe answer is yes.

Here is another presented by someone calling himself Jacob Thomas:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll Muslims carry in their cultural and religious baggage a strong exclusivist belief that they are the guardians of Allah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission and message to all mankind. Danger is on the horizon when this belief becomes extreme and radicalized in certain Muslims. For such persons, this exclusivist may lie dormant in their consciousness until conditions become ripe for putting a more extreme face on this worldview, which in turn can lead to the commission of terrorist acts. A Muslim man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey starts in earnest when he begins attending mosques led by fiery and radical Imams. Such Imams harangue worshippers during the Friday worship services with messages filled with invectives against the Kuffar. All non-Muslims who do not submit to Islam fit into this hated category. Even the most \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoderate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Muslim, attending this type of Friday propagandistic services week after week and month after month, would be made susceptible to forming attitudes and a mindset extremely critical of all non-Muslims that could eventually wreak havoc in various ways, including terror attacks. The continuous virulence of such an Imam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sermons, coupled no doubt with copious quotations from the Qur\u00e2\u0080\u0099an and the Hadiths backing up such rants, would inevitably trigger in the psyche of a believer a dangerous urge to do something \u00e2\u0080\u009cfi Sabeel Allah\u00e2\u0080\u009d (In the Pathway of Allah,). As recent history has proven, Muhammad \u00e2\u0080\u0098Atta and his vicious cohorts certainly gleaned hatred from such instruction and perpetrated the horror of 9-11.\"\n\nPosted by: abhab1 | January 6, 2010 5:43 PM Report Offensive Comment\n\n1.

Keep up-to-date on global religious developments with On Faith."]}, {"title": ["The real 9/11 memorial dispute: a question of sacrilege"], "text": ["The latest improbable chapter in New York City's interminable debate over how to memorialize those who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center is the prospect that an Islamic community and cultural center will be erected just two blocks from the site where some 2,800 people perished at the hands of Islamic fanatics. At a predictably contentious civic meeting, a Manhattan community board gave the go-ahead for construction of the center--to be called Cordoba House and presided over by a highly respected Sufi imam who has denounced terrorism and promoted inter-religious cooperation in New York. Given this imam's reputation, it is understandable that the mayor and top city officials are on board--yet one can only wonder what they were thinking by not suggesting that it might be more, well, politically astute to to locate a large Muslim cultural center farther from the site of the attacks. A more fundamental question--one that haunts every decision regarding the site--is whether a killing ground, where people died simply because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, is necessarily sacred ground.\n\nIt is considered sacrilegous to raise this question, but the absence of any rational answer is the real reason for the dither and delay surrounding every aspect of plans for rebuilding the area around ground zero. Is a piece of earth sanctified because it became a graveyard for unwitting victims of irrational hatred? Which is the more fitting and cautionary Holocaust memorial--the maintenance of Aushchwitz as a tourist magnet or the testimony of survivors? Hundreds or thousands of years from now, when the physical remnants of Auschwitz have no more contemporary meaning than the now-placid stretches of the Appian Way, where Rome tortured and crucified its victims, human beings (if real reading survives digital fragmentation) will still read Primo Levi to understand something about the operation and meaning of this particular evil and evil in general.\n\nAnd--for the literal-minded--no, I am not comparing the Holocaust to 9/11. I am saying that physical memorialization at the site of the crime is probably the least important, and least permanent, way of exploring the depths to which our species can sink and embedding what happened in our collective moral memory. And that is true whether whatever ultimately arises around the ground zero site includes a Muslim center, the inevitable protesters who will demonstrate outside, or dozens of souvenir stores.\n\nThose unfamiliar with New York should know that it will be some years before any real, working buildings are completed at the site. The underground transportation hub, destroyed on 9/11, is now being rebuilt and New Yorkers have been told, yet again, that the last obstacle has been cleared for the erection of a \"Freedom Tower\" taller than the twin towers. This plan for a taller tower than the Twin Towers--a structure that may never be fully occupied unless the State of New York forces employees to work in offices there--strikes me as a particularly stupid piece of hubris, totally out of keeping with any idea of dignified memorialization. Yeah, let's show those terrorists that our new tower is bigger than any tower they pulverized!\n\nThere will, of course, be a memorial to the victims as well as an \"education\" center. No one really knows exactly what can be provided in the way of education about such a recent historical event, and that is one of the major perils of memorialization too soon after the fact. I think that the projected 9/11 memorial should have been limited to a quiet space for contemplation, listing the names of all of the victims, period. The truth is, for all the billions of worlds written about a \"clash of civilizations,\" that we do not have the slightest idea of what terrorism \"means,\" and how recent terrorist acts will fit into the long arc of history. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, it should be noted, did not open in Washington, DC, until 1993--nearly half a century after the end of the horrific acts that took place on the continent of Europe in the middle of the twentieth century. This seems to me the minimum amount of time required for establishment of a commemorative institution with any educational or historical value.\n\nPart of the difficulty in thinking rationally about what ought, and ought not, to be done at ground zero is the American tendency to equate victims with heroes. Unpalatable as it may be to say so, most of the people who died in the Trade Center were not heroes but simply victims. Even the police officers and firefighters who died that day were simply doing their jobs. This not to say that numerous individuals did not act heroically, above and beyond the call of duty, but that many firefighters who perished did so because they were working blind, with faulty, outdated communications equipment, and because bureaucratic turf wars prevented the police and firefighters from talking to each other. Fixing the bureaucratic and technical problems that caused many extra needless deaths is a far more fitting--and living--memorial to the victims than erecting the tallest tower in the world on the site. It is no sacrilege to say that victims do not become heroes by virtue of having been victimized; humanity, not heroism, is all that is required for a life to be valuable.\n\nAll societies wish to memorialize the dead, but ostentatious, quickly erected memorials strike me as nothing more than an effort to satisfy our own need to extract meaning out of meaningless evil. The 9/11 victims died because fanatical men, filled with religious and cultural hatred and financed by a hate-based organization led by another fanatic from a rich Saudi oil family, were willing to give up their own lives in order to express their hatred by killing. What else, really, is there to say at this point, when we know little more about how to confront this hatred than we did on the heartbreakingly clear day when the towers collapsed and the unmistakable smell of death, in the form of jet fuel mixed with plastic and human ash, floated over the city?\n\nIn 1986, in The Drowned and The Saved, Levi wrote:\n\n\"Violence, `useful' or `useless,' is there before our eyes: it snakes either through prosaic and private episodes, or government lawlessness, both in what we call the first and the second worlds, that is to say, the parliamentary democracies and countries in the Communist bloc. In the Third World it is endemic or epidemic. It only awaits its new buffoon (there is no dearth of candidates) to organize it, legalize it, declare it necessary and mandatory, and so contaminate the world. Few countries can be considered immune to a future tide of violence generated by intolerance, lust for power, economic difficulties, religious or political fanaticism, and racialist attritions. It is therefore necessary to sharpen our senses, distrust the prophets, the enchanters, those who speak and write `beautiful words' unsupported by intelligent reasons.\"\n\nThat might be a good passage to inscribe on a 9/11 memorial. With or without a Muslim cultural center two blocks away, how can maudlin tourists learn anything about the real dangers of unreason and violence from a visit to a memorial garden at the site of relatively recent carnage, followed by the purchase of a T-shirt that will undoubtedly display the new, taller tower against a ghostly background of the old twin towers? Memorialization is not memory. Too often, the former is a screen on which we project our understandable yearning for good to come out of evil. Too often, the memorial visit takes the place of actually doing something to ameliorate the damage; we tell ourselves that we are serious people, when what we are really doing is ex post facto rubbernecking.\n\nBy Susan Jacoby | May 29, 2010; 4:19 PM ET Save & Share: Previous: Atheism no longer an unquestioned pejorative |\n\n\"If they allow the Islamic center to be built near ground zero, do the terrorists lose?\" ---------------------------- \"Yes.....and so do racist hatemongers~!\"\n\nAre you saying that if they allow the Islamic center to be built near ground zero, all terrorists and racist hatemongers all over the world will be defeated?\n\nThat seems a little too magical; how will an Islamic center in New York city defeat all the racist hatemongers in Montana, Kansas, Utah, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Nevada, Iowa, etc.?\n\nAnd, if allowing the Islamic center to be built near ground zero will defeat terrorism, why would so many people be against it?\n\nPosted by: PSolus | June 3, 2010 10:06 AMReport Offensive Comment\n\nF-i-N-A-L -- S-O-L-U-T-i-O-N against the\n\nRacist Pakistani Nationals \"Anti-Blasphemy [Sharia] LAW\"s & for The Prevention Of a Holocaust against the Good-Peaceful-Wise AHMADiYYAians Citizens in ISLAMABAD, KARACHi et al whom are treated as Foreigners & Heretics/Keffirs, 2nd rate in their own Nation!:\n\nANSWER: SECEDE!

It took three attempts to convince the Supreme Court that the unborn child being born was a human, though four blind Justices (Stevens, Ginsberg, Souter, & Breyer) still claimed it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a human.\n\n\"The Village Voice reported estimates seven years ago that 20,000 to 100,000 fetuses are sold to drug companies each year in the U.S.\"\n\nPartial-birth abortion was designed to preserve the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vital organs from damage because the organs can bring up to some $6,000.\n\nWe have this testimony from the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine: \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrain cells are harvested from aborted babies for transplant. The tissue cultures are obtained by dropping still \u00e2\u0080\u009cLiving Babies\u00e2\u0080\u009d [to preserve their freshness] into meat grinders and homogenizing them\" (Ibid). \"Dr. Robert Schwartz, chief of pediatrics at the Cleveland Metropolitan Hospital, said that, \"After a baby is delivered, while it is still linked to its mother by the umbilical cord, I take a blood sample, sever the cord and then as quickly as possible remove the organs and tissues\" (Ibid).\n\nOf course, Abortionists view fetuses as laboratory rats and exploit them for monetary value. This is in stark contrast to the so despised and horrid Christian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view that the value of human life is sacred and is the crowning glory of all Creation.\n\nPosted by: TTWSYFAMDGGAHJMJ1 | June 2, 2010 12:01 PMReport Offensive Comment\n\nNymous wrote \"I am so sick of religious people wanting to inject their crazy beliefs into everyone else's lives.\"\n\nLike evolutionist North Korea or evolution subjects in schools?

Maybe two blocks is far away enough but considering the fact that it was people committing this act in the name of their religion, i.e. Islam, it is really beyond my comprehension how the Muslim community could be that immune to the feelings of non-Muslims on this matter. Whether they were misinterpreting Islam or whether other Muslims feel that the attack was un-Islamic is completely irrelevant when no one can actually state with any authority what true Islam is or preaches. The only thing that matters was that those terrorists were acting according to their understanding of Islam, which incidentally appears to be shared by a great many Muslims, albeit a minority, and that their interpretation can be seen as a legitimate and accurate understanding of Muslim texts, including the Quran. I don't really care what the Sufi imam believes, since his interpretation of Islam has no more validity than Ayman al Zawahiri's.\n\nPerhaps, if the Muslim community, for some reason, feels a need to put the mosque that close to ground zero, it should be specfically dedicated not to the vague notion of \"interfaith diablogue\" and \"increasing understanding of Islam\" but, rather, to the dismantling of the Islamic concept of jihad, the condemnation of shariah, and a systematic and critical analysis of the sacred texts of Islam, including the Quran, the Hadith, and the Sira, to either remove or edit those passages, of which there are many, which offer prescriptive guidance to Muslims leading to violence against non-Muslims and Muslim apostates, violence against women and homosexuals, and the subjugation and legal marginalization of non-Muslims. It was Islam that motivated the attacks and it is Islam that needs to be criticized and reformed.\n\nAmericans in general, and New Yorkers in particular, have a rich history of tolerance and religious freedom and we are not the ones who need instruction and education about accepting those who disagree with us.

There are NO ecumenical humanitarian organizations within Islam. There is no attempt to reach out to other 'religions' because Islam is NOT a religion.\n\nThe World will be better off without Islam. Terminating the CULT by destroying its so-called 'holy places' in Saudi Arabia, which can be done NUKE FREE, will end the stinking CULT as no haj pilgrimage will be possible, a requirement of the CULT.\n\nTheir instruction manual, the koran, is a hate-book against all other persons outside of islam.

The death count at Treblinka was similar to Auschwitz, but since Treblinka was purely a death camp, while Auschwitz was also a work camp, practically no one survived Treblinka to talk about it.\n\nNo one who interacted with the perpetrators survived 9/11, and just about everyone in the two WTC buildings who wasn't trapped above the impact point got out. So we don't really have the testimony of anyone at high risk to talk about it.\n\nVictims or heroes? No, they didn't do anything extraordinary. I suspect the motivation to memorialize them stems from the idea that they were just like us and were killed for it. Everyday Americans going about their business were killed by people who hate the fact that every day Americans go about their business and live well for it.\n\nFor now, we'll build a memorial so that people who consider that date the most important in their lives have a place to visit and reflect.

In other words, if you know or can determine either the circumference or the diameter of a circle, you can use pi to calculate the unknown. (Pi is considered irrational because its decimal expansion never ends or repeats.)\n\nIt\u2019s useful because, as scientist Ron Hipschman says, \u201cit involves everyone, even on a removed basis, in a lot of places where you don\u2019t expect it\u2026architecture, art, lightwaves, soundwaves, virtually anything that is cycling in nature.\u201d\n\nPut more simply for mathematical laymen, Mr. Hipschman says, pi \u201ccan be used to figure out the cost of a slice of pizza.\u201d Or maybe even an apple pie. That\u2019s the type of useful application we like here at The Numbers.\n\nThis year is extra special for pi fans, as not only do the month and day correspond with Pi, but the year also represents the next two digits, 3.1415. And the hardcore fan might party extra hard at 9:26:53\u2013a.m. and/or p.m.\u2013as that time would represent the next several digits, 3.141592653.\n\nAt the place where Pi Day was founded by Larry Shaw in 1988, the Exploratorium in San Francisco, the pi-oneers will be taking the irrationality even farther, according to Mr. Hipschman, who\u2019s been on staff at the science center for 44 years. On Saturday, 3/14, at 9:26 a.m. and 53 seconds, the first 58 people in line will be designated VI-Pi\u2019s and receive slightly early access to the museum (and, of course, a slice of pie). That takes pi to: 3.14159265358.\n\nIf you can\u2019t celebrate Pi Day on March 14, some pi enthusiasts (and maybe even a few pie enthusiasts) have taken to celebrating on Pi Approximation Days. One common day is July 22, where 22/7 in the date/month format equals 3.14. Or there\u2019s Sept. 42, which is 3 x pi, or 9.42, though Mr. Hipschman notes that celebrations for that approximation occur on Oct. 12 because, you know, there is no Sept. 42. (Clearly, these pi guys are a fun-loving bunch.)\n\nBut if you can celebrate Pi Day, the Exploratorium and many others who commemorate the day have come up with many inventive ways to honor the importance pi, from pie-throwing free-for-alls to contests for reciting longest string of pi digits to writing songs about pi. (Or you could join math lovers across the country in holy matrimony on this holiest of Pi Days, as WSJ colleague Veronica Dagher writes about in this nice piece.)\n\nBut because we like words at least as much as numbers here at The Numbers blog, our favorite way to celebrate Pi Day was suggested by Mr. Hipschman: writing a pi-ku, or a haiku about pi.\n\nReaders, we hope you\u2019ll join us in celebrating this Pi Day by submitting your pi-ku, and we\u2019ll aim to publish our favorites this coming week.

In the canonical 1938 case of U.S. v. Carolene Products, Justice Stone wrote \u201cthat a statute would deny due process which precluded the disproof in judicial proceedings of all facts which would show or tend to show that a statute depriving the suitor of life, liberty or property had a rational basis.\u201d He then elaborated:\n\nWhere the existence of a rational basis for legislation whose constitutionality is attacked depends upon facts beyond the sphere of judicial notice, such facts may properly be made the subject of judicial inquiry, and the constitutionality of a statute predicated upon the existence of a particular state of facts may be challenged by showing to the court that those facts have ceased to exist.\n\nIndeed, it is a little known fact that the 1928 Filled Milk Act\u2019s bar on the interstate sale of Milnut \u2013 later renamed \u201cMilnot\u201d \u2014 that was upheld in Carolene Products was later invalidated by a federal district court in 1972 as irrational when it was shown that other similar products were being allowed into commerce. In his opinion, District Court Judge Robert Morgan provided the constitutional standard: \u201cWhile Congress may select a particular evil and regulate it to the exclusion of other possible evils in the same industry, any distinction drawn must at least be rational.\u201d\n\nOn the basis of the evidence presented to him at trial, \u201cit appears crystal clear that certain imitation milk and dairy products are so similar to Milnot in composition, appearance, and use that different treatment as to interstate shipment caused by application of the Filled Milk Act to Milnot violates the due process of law to which Milnot Company is constitutionally entitled.\u201d Whatever previous \u201cdairy market conditions and dangers of confusion\u201d had led to the passage and judicial upholding of the Filled Milk Act many years ago, Judge Morgan found that these \u201chave long since ceased to exist.\u201d In short, the Due Process Clause required that the Milnot Company be allowed to present evidence to an impartial judge to show the irrationality of the Filled Milk Act.\n\nFor the New Deal Court (and all courts before), then, the rationality of a statute was a meaningful standard. What changed even before the New Deal was who bore the burden of proof for showing that a restriction on liberty was irrational or arbitrary. In Lochner and other cases, the Court appeared to place the burden on the government (as I favor doing); by the time of Carolene Products, the burden had already been shifted to the challenger (as Justice Harlan had advocated in his Lochner dissent).\n\nWhat we think of as the meaningless \u201crational basis\u201d test actually comes from a 1955 Warren Court case of Williamson v. Lee Optical, in which the Supreme Court reversed the lower court\u2019s realistic appraisal that restrictions placed on opticians were irrational means of protecting the health and safety of the public. In an ironic repudiation of realism, Justice Douglass replaced a realistic rationality review by instead accepting any hypothetical reason for a law that a court might imagine. Yet the Court has never expressly repudiated the Carolene Products approach, and has since oftentimes employed a \u201crational basis with teeth\u201d approach that seems inconsistent with Williamson.\n\nNow comes a cert petition from the Institute for Justice that gives the Court an opportunity to reaffirm the reasoning of Carolene Products, which allows individuals to challenge the \u201cthe constitutionality of a statute predicated upon the existence of a particular state of facts . . . by showing to the court that those facts have ceased to exist.\u201d\n\nIn Heffner v. Murphy, the Institute for Justice is challenging the rationality of several restrictions on the ownership and operation of funeral homes in Pennsylvania. While the lower court had ruled that, in light of changing circumstances, these rules were irrational, the Third Circuit rejected the principle that the rationality of a statute depends on the rationality of its application now: \u201cAs a threshold matter, we surmise that much of the District Court\u2019s conclusions regarding the constitutionality of the [Funeral Law], enacted in 1952, stem from a view that certain provisions of the [Funeral Law] are antiquated in light of how funeral homes now operate. That is not, however, a constitutional flaw.\u201d\n\nBut if \u201crationality\u201d is what constitutionally justifies a restriction on liberty, there is no good reason why a law should not still be rational when applied to a particular person, and why that person should not be able to show why the law was irrational as applied to his activity, the way it was to Milnot. As the Institute points out in its brief:\n\nThe rule of Carolene Products protects our constitutional rights by ensuring that the enforcement of a statute must be rational, and not merely that the statute itself was rational at some distant point in the past. The changed-circumstances doctrine is a particularly important protection because the separation-of powers principles at the heart of rational-basis review are attenuated when the factual circumstances of a law\u2019s passage bear little resemblance to the real world many years later.\n\nThis is the appropriate way for constitutional law to \u201clive\u201d and adjust to changing circumstances in the context of a written constitution with a fixed original meaning.\n\nIt bears emphasizing that the rule of Carolene Products is not a rule about how the Constitution itself changes, a rule about how courts ought to strike down unpopular laws when public sentiment shifts, or a rule allowing courts to institute their own social and economic policies. The meaning of the Constitution remains the same, public sentiment is irrelevant, and courts may not substitute their preferences for those of the elected branches. Instead, the modest rule of Carolene Products simply ensures that when government officials take away a liberty interest today, they do so for reasons that are rational today, not merely for reasons that were rational long ago.\n\nAllowing as applied challenges to the rationality of a statute based on changing circumstances is an approach that both originalists and \u201cliving constitutionalists\u201d can and should embrace. And a realistic rationality review allows for the protection of liberty without the heightened scrutiny that results from finding a particular liberty to be a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d\n\nUnder existing doctrine, elevating a liberty to \u201cfundamental rights\u201d status creates a virtual \u201ctrump\u201d over legislative power, so must be only sparingly employed. The much easier-to-satisfy rationality review allows both greater exercise of governmental powers while still protecting liberty, and that is so even when following a presumption of constitutionality in favor of the statute.\n\nThe difference between Carolene Products and Williamson is whether or not the presumption of constitutionality is rebuttable. The New Deal Court insisted it was; the Warren Court suggested it was not. Lower courts have been divided ever since, which would make this a very useful, as well as very important, grant of cert.\n\nBy taking seriously a showing that a restriction of liberty is irrational, the Court can get itself out of the business of recognizing some \u201cpreferred freedoms\u201d as so \u201cfundamental\u201d that they merit protection while other liberties do not \u2014 while avoiding the super scrutiny that interferes with the proper discretion of legislatures. Ironically, the Court can accomplish both objectives simply by following its New Deal precedent.\n\nRandy Barnett is the Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory, Georgetown University Law Center, and Director of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution.

It's not that you resolve to be virtuous on Thanksgiving, just reasonable. Two plates of food, and no more. One piece of pie, and that's enough. But when you're sitting at that table, staring at that food, there is no more self-control. No more reasonable. You stop when you can hardly breathe.\n\nOr maybe I'm projecting. This column, however, will not be about exercising self-control at the table. It's Thanksgiving! Rather, this column will be about something far more powerful: exercising some economic principles.\n\nFor a long time, economists operated under the \"rational actor model.\" Human beings were thought to be rational creatures who correctly weighed costs and benefits and calculated the best choices for themselves. Then some economists met some human beings and realized we don't really work like that. The result has been the rise of \"behavioral economics,\" which attempts to build the responses of actual human beings into its models.\n\nMIT economist Dan Ariely is a pioneer in the field. His bestselling book \"Predictably Irrational\" is as good an introduction to the discipline as you'll find. Human beings, he argues, aren't just irrational: They are irrational in predictable ways and in predictable circumstances. That means we can plan for that irrationality beforehand, when we're still feeling rational.\n\nI asked Ariely how he would set up his Thanksgiving feast to limit overeating without having to exercise self-control. His answer was to construct the \"architecture\" of the meal beforehand. Create conditions that guide people toward good choices, or even use their irrationality to your benefit.\n\n\"Move to chopsticks!\" he exclaimed, making bites smaller and harder to take. If the chopsticks are a bit extreme, smaller plates and utensils might work the same way. Study after study shows that people eat more when they have more in front of them. It's one of our predictable irrationalities: We judge portions by how much is left rather than how full we feel. Smaller portions lead us to eat less, even if we can refill the plate.\n\nSpeaking of which, Ariely suggests placing the food \"far away.\" In this case, serve from the kitchen rather than the table. If people have to get up to add another scoop of mashed potatoes, they're less likely to take their fifth serving than if they simply have to reach in front of them.\n\n\"Start with a soup course,\" he says. That is what economists refer to as a default: Rather than putting everything on the table for people to choose, you begin by making the choice for your guests. If the first course is relatively filling and relatively low in calories, everyone will eat less during the rest of the meal.\n\nIndeed, it's not a bad idea to limit the total number of courses. Variety stimulates appetite. As evidence, Ariely brings up a study conducted on mice. A male mouse and a female mouse will soon tire of mating with each other. But put new partners into the cage, and it turns out they weren't tired at all. They were just bored. So, too, with food. \"Imagine you only had one dish,\" he says. \"How much could you eat?\"\n\nWhat you eat, of course, is also important. Studies show that people aren't very consistent in the amount of calories they eat each day, but they're very consistent in the volume of food they eat each day. Thanksgiving is an exception to that consistency, but probably not to the underlying rule. Satisfaction doesn't depend on caloric intake; low-calorie, high-fiber foods and foods high in water content are filling. Thus, the more broccoli rabe there is at the table, the better.\n\nSpeaking of which, take a page out of the pilgrims' book and make sure all the food at the table was cooked by someone in the house. Economists believe that the obesity epidemic is largely attributable to the rise in food we don't make for ourselves. In 1900, it was hard to snack on potato chips because it was time-consuming for a member of the household to make potato chips. Today, of course, things are different, and there is a surfeit of vending machines and drive-throughs and supermarkets. But on Thanksgiving, make like you're in Plymouth, and ensure all of the food is homemade. There will be fewer calories available if Grandma's stuffing isn't supplemented with bowls of chips and cheese.\n\nFor all that, Ariely's main advice is not to worry too much about Turkey Day. \"I don't think Thanksgiving is a time to watch your diet,\" he says. \"How many calories can you put away in a day? Maybe 5,000 or 6,000 calories, if you really try hard.\" The problem, he says, is another human irrationality: remembering to pay attention to the season's big meals but not the everyday ones in between. The solution to overeating, Ariely says, \"comes from [making] small changes across many normal meals.\"\n\nThat seems rational. But if you insist on trying to cut back at Thanksgiving, Ariely does have one more piece of advice: \"Wear a very tight shirt.\""], "summary": ["Ezra Klein considers the behavioral economics of overeating."]}, {"title": ["Why Dreams Mean Less Than We Think"], "text": ["Most people dream enthusiastically at night, their dreams seemingly occupying hours, even though most last only a few minutes. Most people also read great meaning into their nocturnal visions. In fact, according to a new study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the vast majority of people in three very different countries \u0097 India, South Korea and the United States \u0097 believe that their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths.\n\nAccording to the study, 74% of Indians, 65% of South Koreans and 56% of Americans hold an old-fashioned Freudian view of dreams: that they are portals into the unconscious. (See the top 10 scientific discoveries of 2008.)\n\nBut after so many years of brain research showing that most of our everyday cognitions result from a complex but observable interaction of proteins and neurons and other mostly uncontrolled cellular activity, how can so many otherwise rational people think dreams should be taken seriously? After all, brain activity isn't mystical but \u0097 for the most part \u0097 highly predictable.\n\nThe authors of the study \u0097 psychologists Carey Morewedge of Carnegie Mellon University and Michael Norton of Harvard \u0097 offer a few theories. For one, dreams often feature familiar people and locations, which means we are less willing to dismiss them outright. Also, because we can't trace the content of dreams to an external source \u0097 because that content seems to arise spontaneously and from within \u0097 we can't explain it the way we can explain random thoughts that occur to us during waking hours. If you find yourself sitting at your desk and thinking about a bomb exploding in your office, you might say to yourself, \"Oh, I watched 24 last night, so I'm just remembering that episode.\" But people have a harder time making sense of dreams. Maybe 24 caused the dream, we think \u0097 or maybe we're having a premonition of an attack. We love to interpret dreams widely, and those acts of interpretation give dreams meaning. (Read \"Can't Sleep? Turn Off the Cell Phone!\")\n\nHuman beings are irrational about dreams the same way they are irrational about a lot of things. We make dumb choices all the time on the basis of silly information like racial bias or a misunderstanding of statistics \u0097 or dreams. Morewedge and Norton quote one of the most famous modern studies to demonstrate our collective folly, from a paper written by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman that was published in Science in 1974. In that paper, Tversky and Kahneman discuss an experiment in which subjects were asked to estimate the percentage of African countries represented in the U.N. Before they guessed, a researcher spun a wheel of fortune in front of them that landed on a random number between 0 and 100. People tended to pick an answer that wasn't far from the number on the wheel, even though the wheel had nothing to do with African countries.\n\nCountless experiments over the ensuing decades have confirmed that most of us make this so-called anchoring mistake \u0097 that is, making a decision based largely on an unrelated piece of information, like a random number that appears on a wheel. Anchoring occurs all the time, like when you're asked to look at your Social Security number before answering a question (you're more likely to pick an answer close to the digits in your SSN). A team of researchers even showed in a 2003 paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics that people will endure more physical discomfort (exposure to an unpleasant noise) for less monetary compensation in a lab setting when they are anchored prior to the experiments to smaller monetary amounts. As I said, we all make dumb choices based on silly information. That's why we invest meaning in dreams. (See TIME's 2004 cover on the science of sleep.)\n\nThat being said, dumb choices aren't necessarily bad ones. A final finding from the study: When people have dreams about good things happening to their good friends, they are more likely to say those dreams are meaningful than when they have dreams about bad things happening to their friends. Similarly, we invest more meaning in dreams in which our enemies are punished and less meaning in dreams in which our enemies emerge victorious. In short, our interpretation of dreams may say a lot less about some quixotic search for hidden truth than it does about another enduring human quality: optimistic thinking.\n\nRead \"While You Were Sleeping.\"\n\nSee the top 10 medical breakthroughs of 2008."], "summary": ["Most people \u0097 even reasonable people \u0097 read meaning into their dreams.

It's not that you resolve to be virtuous on Thanksgiving, just reasonable. Two plates of food, and no more. One piece of pie, and that's enough. But when you're sitting at that table, staring at that food, there is no more self-control. No more reasonable. You stop when you can hardly breathe.\n\nOr maybe I'm projecting. This column, however, will not be about exercising self-control at the table. It's Thanksgiving! Rather, this column will be about something far more powerful: exercising some economic principles.\n\nTurkeys don't know economics. (Melina Mara / The Washington Post)\n\nFor a long time, economists operated under the \"rational actor model.\" Human beings were thought to be rational creatures who correctly weighed costs and benefits and calculated the best choices for themselves. Then some economists met some human beings and realized we don't really work like that. The result has been the rise of \"behavioral economics,\" which attempts to build the responses of actual human beings into its models.\n\nMIT economist Dan Ariely is a pioneer in the field. His bestselling book \"Predictably Irrational\" is as good an introduction to the discipline as you'll find. Human beings, he argues, aren't just irrational: They are irrational in predictable ways and in predictable circumstances. That means we can plan for that irrationality beforehand, when we're still feeling rational.\n\nI asked Ariely how he would set up his Thanksgiving feast to limit overeating without having to exercise self-control. His answer was to construct the \"architecture\" of the meal beforehand. Create conditions that guide people toward good choices, or even use their irrationality to your benefit.\n\n\"Move to chopsticks!\" he exclaimed, making bites smaller and harder to take. If the chopsticks are a bit extreme, smaller plates and utensils might work the same way. Study after study shows that people eat more when they have more in front of them. It's one of our predictable irrationalities: We judge portions by how much is left rather than how full we feel. Smaller portions lead us to eat less, even if we can refill the plate.\n\nSpeaking of which, Ariely suggests placing the food \"far away.\" In this case, serve from the kitchen rather than the table. If people have to get up to add another scoop of mashed potatoes, they're less likely to take their fifth serving than if they simply have to reach in front of them.\n\n\"Start with a soup course,\" he says. That is what economists refer to as a default: Rather than putting everything on the table for people to choose, you begin by making the choice for your guests. If the first course is relatively filling and relatively low in calories, everyone will eat less during the rest of the meal.\n\nIndeed, it's not a bad idea to limit the total number of courses. Variety stimulates appetite. As evidence, Ariely brings up a study conducted on mice. A male mouse and a female mouse will soon tire of mating with each other. But put new partners into the cage, and it turns out they weren't tired at all. They were just bored. So, too, with food. \"Imagine you only had one dish,\" he says. \"How much could you eat?\"\n\nWhat you eat, of course, is also important. Studies show that people aren't very consistent in the amount of calories they eat each day, but they're very consistent in the volume of food they eat each day. Thanksgiving is an exception to that consistency, but probably not to the underlying rule. Satisfaction doesn't depend on caloric intake; low-calorie, high-fiber foods and foods high in water content are filling. Thus, the more broccoli rabe there is at the table, the better.\n\nSpeaking of which, take a page out of the pilgrims' book and make sure all the food at the table was cooked by someone in the house. Economists believe that the obesity epidemic is largely attributable to the rise in food we don't make for ourselves. In 1900, it was hard to snack on potato chips because it was time-consuming for a member of the household to make potato chips. Today, of course, things are different, and there is a surfeit of vending machines and drive-throughs and supermarkets. But on Thanksgiving, make like you're in Plymouth, and ensure all of the food is homemade. There will be fewer calories available if Grandma's stuffing isn't supplemented with bowls of chips and cheese.\n\nFor all that, Ariely's main advice is not to worry too much about Turkey Day. \"I don't think Thanksgiving is a time to watch your diet,\" he says. \"How many calories can you put away in a day? Maybe 5,000 or 6,000 calories, if you really try hard.\" The problem, he says, is another human irrationality: remembering to pay attention to the season's big meals but not the everyday ones in between.

Look for these classics on the weekends.\n\nSome things are seemingly impossible to explain. I mean, how do spiders know how to spin such beautiful webs? What ever inspired the construction of Stonehenge? And why is Taylor Swift so darn popular?\n\nOne particularly perplexing question that scientists have been diligently working to reveal is the reason why people make weird decisions about money.\n\nAs Michael Shermer explains in the Los Angeles Times, there have been countless experiments in behavioral economics that demonstrate when it comes to money, reason and rationality are often trumped by our emotions and feelings.\n\nShermer highlights three behavioral experiments that are used by scientists to measure people\u2019s rationality with respect to money that I found to be really interesting \u2014 and so I want to share them with you.\n\nHere are the scenarios. What decisions would you make for each of them?\n\n1. Assuming that prices of goods and services stay the same, would you rather earn:\n\nA. $50,000 a year while other people make $25,000 B. $100,000 a year while other people get $250,000\n\nDid you pick option A? Although that is completely irrational, research shows that the majority of people would rather make twice as much as others \u2014 even if that meant earning half as much as they could otherwise have.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s see how you would handle the next scenario:\n\n2. Nancy and Karen are standing in line at different movie theaters. Who would you rather be?\n\nNancy: She gets to the ticket window and is told that as the 100,000th customer of the theater she has just won $100. Karen: She gets to the window and wins a consolation prize of $150 after the man in front of her won $1,000 for being the one-millionth customer of the theater.\n\nWould you rather be in Karen\u2019s shoes? That\u2019s what a person thinking rationally would choose but, once again, the rational thinkers were in the minority. Yep. The majority would rather forgo $50 in order to alleviate the feeling of regret that comes with not winning $1000!\n\nHere\u2019s one last scenario based on something called \u201cThe Ultimatum Game:\u201d\n\n3. I was given $100 by a friend of mine to split between me and you. Here\u2019s the catch: Whatever division of the money I propose, if you accept it, we\u2019ll both get to keep our share. If, however, you reject my proposal, neither of us will get any money. I\u2019m proposing a 90/10 split; of course, I\u2019d get $90 and you\u2019d get $10. Do you accept or reject my proposal?\n\nThink about it for a second. If you\u2019re rational you\u2019re going to accept my offer, pocket the $10, and feel good that you just got something for nothing. But research shows that offers of less than $30 are usually rejected. Behavioral scientists say this is because an emotion evolved in man known as \u201creciprocal altruism\u201d demands fairness on the part of our potential exchange partners.\n\nAmazingly enough, this moral sense of fairness is not only hard-wired into the brains of most humans, but primates as well.\n\nSo \u2026 How did you do? Are you rational or irrational when it comes to money?\n\nMore From Len Penzo dot COM:"], "summary": ["Rationality is often trumped by emotion."]}]
