[{"title": ["The racist ideas of slave owners are still with us today"], "text": ["On Sunday evening, the ITV series Victoria imagined Prince Albert addressing the great anti-slavery convention at Exeter Hall, on the continued existence of the slave trade and slavery. It went so far as to show an encounter between Albert, a freed African-American and American feminists attending the convention.\n\nIt was engaging television. But don\u2019t be fooled. People of colour and women were in reality marginalised at this famous 1840 event. And while Albert supported anti-slavery causes, other significant royals, including Victoria\u2019s uncle the Duke of Cumberland, opposed the ending of the slave trade and slavery.\n\nIn fact, between 10% and 15% of the 19th-century British elite had connections with slave ownership. Such connections survive today. For example, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice are descended through their mother, Sarah Ferguson, from Sir Henry Fitzherbert, who in the 18th century owned sugar plantations and more than 1,000 enslaved men, women and children, in Jamaica and Barbados.\n\nThe processes by which Africans became \u2018negroes\u2019 and \u2018slaves\u2019 took place on the slave ships and plantations\n\nSince 2009 I have been working with a team of historians on the Legacies of British Slave Ownership project at University College London. Our initial research was compiled from the records of the compensation paid to slave owners following slavery\u2019s abolition in 1833. This was significant because the compensation paid by British taxpayers contributed in important ways to the making of modern industrial Britain and its empire.\n\nWe chose to work on the slave owners \u2013 English, Scots, Irish and Welsh, mostly men but also women \u2013 as a way of demonstrating the extent to which thousands of white Britons were directly implicated in the exploitation of enslaved Africans. The project has attracted a great deal of attention, and was made into two Bafta-winning TV documentaries.\n\nThe key driver of the slave trade was, of course, the desire to make money. But its longer-term legacy runs well beyond that. For in order to make money the traders had to create a new discourse on \u201crace\u201d; and the impact of those ideas needs to be remembered too.\n\nBy studying pamphlets, wills, correspondence and other papers kept by slave owners, we can explore how they understood race and attempted to justify their ownership of other people. This week sees the launch of a major new data set and the start of the next phase of work at the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave Ownership at UCL, supported by the Hutchins Center at Harvard.\n\nThe processes by which Africans became \u201cnegroes\u201d who became \u201cslaves\u201d, took place across the African coast, on the slave ships, and on the plantations of the Caribbean. The slave owners\u2019 insistence on skin colour as a marker of identity continues to haunt us. Edward Long\u2019s celebrated History of Jamaica, a key text for pro-slavers and racists who believe in the natural and essential differences between black and white, was first published in 1774 and is still in print today.\n\nIdeas about racial difference that began with slavery were recalibrated across the centuries to encompass other colonised subjects \u2013 whether Indian, Aboriginal or east Asian. All were defined as racialised others, inferior to white Britons, and this process was central to imperial rule.\n\nA British history that told this story of exclusion would help us to understand the present. \u201cThe great force of history,\u201d wrote the African-American activist and writer James Baldwin, \u201ccomes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.\u201d The structures and practices that underpin black inequality are not new.\n\nBritain likes to tell a story about itself as a tolerant and inclusive nation, the first to abolish the slave trade and slavery: in essence, of a long slow march from Magna Carta to our contemporary, democratic society. This remains powerful and attempts to challenge or question it are strongly resisted.\n\nHistory, however, provides us with the means to pursue that questioning. Britons need to grasp a history that takes responsibility for the debt \u2013 moral, political and economic \u2013 owed to others, to give us a much stronger understanding of the benefits that we at the imperial centre have reaped. One such example is the current campaign by Caribbean nations for reparation, which demands an exploration of the continuities between Atlantic slavery and the present day.\n\nMy work as a historian has convinced me that ways of thinking about race are the most destructive legacy of Britain\u2019s imperial past. In the wake of the Brexit vote we have witnessed a deeply disturbing increase in the number of hate crimes committed against Poles, Muslims and racial minorities. Globalisation, with all the losses it has brought for so many, has clearly acted as a trigger for this upsurge of rage and resentment, the wish to \u201ctake back control\u201d and \u201csecure our borders\u201d.\n\nThe legacy of slavery is the dehumanisation of others and assumptions of white superiority, as well as terrible disparities of wealth and power. These could not be starker than they are today."], "summary": ["The surge in hate crime since the Brexit vote is one legacy of an overlooked period of British history"]}, {"title": ["The sincere fiction of Goree Island, Africa\u2019s best-known slave trade memorial"], "text": ["President Obama looks out of the \u201cdoor of no return\u201d during a tour of Goree Island. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nPresident Obama visited one of Africa\u2019s most famous memorials to the slave trade on Thursday, the House of Slaves on Senegal\u2019s Goree Island. The official story is that millions of African slaves passed through the house\u2019s Door of No Return, which faces West across the Atlantic; countless visitors have come to contemplate the slave trade and to pay heartfelt tribute, including Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II and the last three U.S. presidents.\n\nExcept that the official story turns out to be largely a myth. Historians have agreed since the 1990s that the house was likely just a private residence that had nothing to do with the slave trade. Earlier, we explored this long-standing disconnect between the reality and myth of Goree Island, why it\u2019s proven so resilient and what it says about the world\u2019s struggle to deal with this dark chapter in history.\n\nUniversity of Chicago historical anthropologist Fran\u00e7ois Richard, a West Africa scholar who has studied the slave trade, has some thoughts about that disconnect between the myth and reality of Goree. Richard emphasizes the house\u2019s value as a sort of manifestation of slavery\u2019s legacy, which is still so big today that it demands this sort of totem. He reproduces a term that seems to capture the phenomenon well: it is a \u201csincere fiction.\u201d Here\u2019s Richard:\n\n1) Yes, there has been heated academic debate around Gor\u00e9e, but in the mid-90s (following a controversial article written in 1996 in Le Monde). The debates have largely been on the revisionist side, and most historians today would argue that the scale of the slave trade in Gor\u00e9e was likely much lower than in many other parts of western Africa (for a variety of reasons. I should note, however, that turning the question of international slavery into a statistical exercise is not the most useful way to think about it, and sadly that legacy has clouded academic debates more than it has helped). So, Gor\u00e9e was a transit point, though the volume of trade there was \u2018fairly\u2019 low (square quotes are important here) and that it ebbed and flowed over time, probably decreasing over time, especially after the 1750s, as captives were increasingly retained in Senegal to work in food production. [Max here: When Richard says 'fairly' low, he is referring to estimates of, for example, 33,000 slaves, a huge number by every possible standard except for the actual trans-Atlantic slave trade of several million.]\n\n2) Yes, there was slavery on the island, but of a much different kind than the chattel slavery that was established on plantations in the Caribbean and Americas.\n\n3) The House of Slaves holds a huge amount of symbolic value as a \u2018place of memory,\u2019 a testimony to a not-so-savory part of global history. In this sense, the house was erected into a \u2018myth\u2019 (or perhaps, a term I\u2019d prefer, to follow sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, a sincere fiction) and mobilized as memento.\n\nAs far as archives will go, the house was built probably in the 1770s, thus rather late in the era of the Atlantic trade, at a point when the commerce in slaves was diminishing and when the gum trade was gaining ascendance. What\u2019s more, it was a residential structure, upper floor were living quarters, lower sections were probably for merchandise and magazine. And yes, the enslaved people living there were probably attached to the house (cooks, domestics, laborers, traders, etc.).\n\nSome people use the history/memory couplet to parse the problem of Gor\u00e9e\u2019s house of slaves (i.e., history concerned with facts and memory with symbolic value and historical gravity, a mode of affective resonance absolutely central to identities in the African diaspora). It\u2019s not the most satisfying or cutting way of analyzing the phenomenon, but it has the merit of offering a point of entry. What \u2018s important to remember, though, is that while the details about the house may not be entirely exact, they do speak to a deeper historical truth \u2013 namely, the experience and infamy of turning humanity into a commodity.\n\nA \u201cpoint of entry\u201d is a nice way to describe Goree\u2019s famous monument, which is, after all, a literal entry point \u2013 the Door of No Return. As some scholars have written, even if slaves never really exited through the Door, members of the African diaspora created by slavery have since used the site as a way to engage with that legacy, making it sort of like a Door of Return to a past that was very real even if the symbol\u2019s official history is not.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne) (The Associated Press)\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2013 A plan to open what would be the nation's only museum centered on the trans-Atlantic slave trade would focus on the Episcopal Church's role in its history and the sometimes-buried legacy of slavery in northern states like Rhode Island.\n\nThe museum at the shuttered Cathedral of St. John, a church where slaves once worshipped, would explore how the church benefited from the trade and helped bring it to an end, said Bishop Nicholas Knisely of the Diocese of Rhode Island.\n\n\"Our story's mixed,\" he said. \"We haven't talked in the country about the role of religion and religious voices in abolition and the slave trade.\"\n\nTo make it happen, the diocese is working with the Tracing Center, a group set up by descendants of what was once the nation's most prolific slave-trading family, and Brown University, which in recent years has worked to come to grips with its own connection to slavery.\n\nThe Rev. Canon Linda L. Grenz calls it a \"teaching museum\" and says it would be part of a larger project to show how people can use painful history to help overcome differences and be honest with one another.\n\nDiocesan officials emphasize the plan is still in the early stages. They don't yet have a way to pay for converting the 200-year-old building, and they're not sure what they want it to look like.\n\nA Brown report issued in 2006 found that about 60 percent of all slave-trading voyages launched from North America came from Rhode Island. More than 1,000 slave-trading voyages were launched from Rhode Island, the report says, and 80 of those came from one family, the DeWolfs of Bristol.\n\nJames DeWolf Perry, executive director of the Massachusetts-based Tracing Center, which works to promote greater awareness of the legacy of slavery, is a descendent who is working with the diocese. His great-grandfather was bishop of Rhode Island, chose St. John's as the diocese's cathedral and served as the denomination's presiding bishop \u2014 its leader in the United States.\n\n\"What's dropped out of our public memory, largely as a result of the Civil War, is that the North had a great deal of slavery,\" he said. \"We like to talk about as if most Northerners were anti-slavery and abolitionists.\"\n\nIn fact, the North benefited economically from slavery, and the Episcopal Church \"institutionally was deeply complicit in slavery, benefited from it,\" he said.\n\nSeveral museums in the U.S. address slavery, but hardly any are specifically devoted to it, Perry said. One, the Whitney Plantation, is opening in Louisiana next month but focuses on plantation history and slavery in the South. Elsewhere, the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool, England, opened in 2007.\n\nAnthony Bogues, director of the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice at Brown, was part of the committee that reported on how the university benefited from slavery: Some buildings at the Ivy League school were built by slaves, and some early Brown benefactors were slave owners, for example.\n\nBogues, who hopes to be integrally involved in the project, said it could be a national model for dealing with the legacies of slavery.\n\n\"We have not yet, I think, had a full national conversation on race and racism,\" he said.\n\nMost Americans do not understand how deeply involved the colonies and early United States were in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, said David Blight, director of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition at Yale University.\n\nBlight, who has advised some similar projects including the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, encouraged the organizers to assemble a strong team of historical advisers.\n\n\"It's all about how you present a very difficult history, a disorienting history, to the broadest possible public including young people. That isn't easy to do, but it's a tremendous and wonderful challenge,\" he said. \"Museums rarely can reconcile a society, but they surely can present good history, a lesson that can be learned.\"\n\nKnisely said despite the challenges, he can feel God's presence as the vision is discussed and people come forward to help.\n\n\"God's going to give us what we need to make it happen,\" he said."], "summary": ["A plan to open what would be the nation's only museum centered on the trans-Atlantic slave trade would focus on the Episcopal Church's role in its history and the sometimes-buried legacy of slavery in northern states like Rhode Island."]}, {"title": ["Forgotten Step Toward Freedom"], "text": ["Nonetheless, the abolition of the slave trade to the United States is well worth remembering. Only a small fraction (perhaps 5 percent) of the estimated 11 million Africans brought to the New World in the four centuries of the slave trade were destined for the area that became the United States. But in the Colonial era, Southern planters regularly purchased imported slaves, and merchants in New York and New England profited handsomely from the trade.\n\nThe American Revolution threw the slave trade and slavery itself into crisis. In the run-up to war, Congress banned the importation of slaves as part of a broader nonimportation policy. During the War of Independence, tens of thousands of slaves escaped to British lines. Many accompanied the British out of the country when peace arrived.\n\nInspired by the ideals of the Revolution, most of the newly independent American states banned the slave trade. But importation resumed to South Carolina and Georgia, which had been occupied by the British during the war and lost the largest number of slaves.\n\nThe slave trade was a major source of disagreement at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. South Carolina\u2019s delegates were determined to protect slavery, and they had a powerful impact on the final document. They originated the three-fifths clause (giving the South extra representation in Congress by counting part of its slave population) and threatened disunion if the slave trade were banned, as other states demanded.\n\nThe result was a compromise barring Congress from prohibiting the importation of slaves until 1808. Some Anti-Federalists, as opponents of ratification were called, cited the slave trade clause as a reason why the Constitution should be rejected, claiming it brought shame upon the new nation.\n\nThe outbreak of the slave revolution in Haiti in the early 1790s sent shock waves of fear throughout the American South and led to new state laws barring the importation of slaves. But in 1803, as cotton cultivation spread, South Carolina reopened the trade. The Legislature of the newly acquired Louisiana Territory also allowed the importation of slaves. From 1803 to 1808, between 75,000 and 100,000 Africans entered the United States.\n\nBy this time, the international slave trade was widely recognized as a crime against humanity. In 1807, Congress prohibited the importation of slaves from abroad, to take effect the next New Year\u2019s Day, the first date allowed by the Constitution.\n\nFor years thereafter, free African-Americans celebrated Jan. 1 as an alternative to July 4, when, in their view, patriotic orators hypocritically proclaimed the slave-owning United States a land of liberty.\n\nIt is easy to understand, however, why the trade\u2019s abolition appears so anticlimactic. Banning American participation in the slave trade did not end the shipment of Africans to the Western Hemisphere. Some three million more slaves were brought to Brazil and Spanish America before the trade finally ended. With Southerners dominating the federal government for most of the period before the Civil War, enforcement was lax and the smuggling of slaves into the United States continued.\n\nThose who hoped that ending American participation in the slave trade would weaken or destroy slavery were acutely disappointed. In the United States, unlike the West Indies, the slave population grew by natural increase. This was not because American owners were especially humane, but because most of the South lies outside the tropical environment where diseases like yellow fever and malaria exacted a huge toll on whites and blacks alike.\n\nAs slavery expanded into the Deep South, a flourishing internal slave trade replaced importation from Africa. Between 1808 and 1860, the economies of older states like Virginia came increasingly to rely on the sale of slaves to the cotton fields of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. But demand far outstripped supply, and the price of slaves rose inexorably, placing ownership outside the reach of poorer Southerners.\n\nLet us imagine that the African slave trade had continued in a legal and open manner well into the 19th century. It is plausible to assume that hundreds of thousands if not millions of Africans would have been brought into the country.\n\nThis most likely would have resulted in the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of slavery as prices fell and more and more whites could afford to purchase slaves, along with a further increase in Southern political power thanks to the Constitution\u2019s three-fifths clause. These were the very reasons advanced by South Carolina\u2019s political leaders when they tried, unsuccessfully, to reopen the African slave trade in the 1850s.\n\nMore slaves would also have meant heightened fear of revolt and ever more stringent controls on the slave population. It would have reinforced Southerners\u2019 demands to annex to the United States areas suitable for plantation slavery in the Caribbean and Central America. Had the importation of slaves continued unchecked, the United States could well have become the hemispheric slave-based empire of which many Southerners dreamed.\n\nJan. 1, 1808, is worth commemorating not only for what it directly accomplished, but for helping to save the United States from a history even more terrible than the Civil War that eventually rid our country of slavery.\n\nAn Op-Ed article on Sunday, about the bicentennial of the banning of slave importations into the United States, misstated the span of time since the end of World War II. The year 2005 was the 60th anniversary of that war\u2019s end, not the 50th.\n\nEric Foner is a professor of history at Columbia University.\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on , on Page 410 of the New York edition with the headline: Forgotten Step Toward Freedom.

Several years ago the historian David Brion Davis wrote an intriguing article in which he asked, and answered, a counterfactual question: What if the Confederacy had won recognition from Britain in 1862 and survived the war? His rather frightening answer was that the three great centers of slavery in the Americas \u2014 the American South, Cuba and Brazil \u2014 plus the smaller plantation economy of Dutch Suriname, would not have abolished slavery when they did.\n\nDisunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.\n\nThat the Civil War and the subsequent Thirteenth Amendment ended slavery in the United States is self-evident. What\u2019s less well known is that the Civil War also had immense significance for the ending of slavery elsewhere, especially in the Americas. Indeed, few people recognize that it took a war to finally bring the brutal transatlantic slave trade to a close. In all likelihood, without a Union victory, slavery would have remained a central institution underpinning global economic growth until possibly the present day.\n\nIt\u2019s true that only a small share \u2014 about 4 percent \u2014 of the total slaves carried off from Africa landed on the North American mainland. And an even smaller share of those destined for slavery in the rest of the Americas completed their voyage in vessels flying the United States flag, or set sail from mainland ports.\n\nYet small as the United States role was, there is no doubt that the federal government effectively protected transatlantic slave traders in the half-century before 1861 and that the outbreak of the Civil War just as effectively removed that protection. Indeed, thanks to America\u2019s role, almost one-quarter of the total transatlantic slave trade occurred after the government banned American participation in the slave trade in 1807.\n\nHow was it possible for such a minor player to have such a large impact? The answer turns on the nature of the nascent system of international law that had emerged by the early 19th century, and the fact that the transatlantic slave trade was perhaps the most thoroughly multinational business of the early modern era.\n\nFor one thing, Denmark, the United States and Britain, the first nations to take action against the trade, might have banned their own citizens from participating and forbid the entry of slaves into their own territories, but without negotiating international treaties, they could do nothing to stop foreign nationals carrying on the slave trade elsewhere \u2014 including the high seas.\n\nAfter 1807, the British constructed an elaborate, costly but ultimately ineffective network of treaties that allowed their cruisers to stop suspected slave vessels flying the flags of other nations. But it didn\u2019t cover all countries, and in these years slave ships sailed under the colors of Mexico, Russia, Sardinia and Argentina, among many others, solely because these flags prevented British intervention. And as long as a single nation allowed its flag to be used in this way, and as long as Brazil and Cuba remained open to new arrivals from Africa, the transatlantic slave trade would continue.\n\nMoreover, France and the United States never allowed the British to stop and search their own merchant vessels. Instead, they undertook to patrol the Atlantic themselves. The French at one stage assigned more than 40 warships to anti-slave trade duties. The American fleet, on the other hand, never exceeded six warships and for years at a time the country deployed none at all. And neither nation sought permission to stop and search suspected slave ships operating under another flag. As a consequence, the British navy accounted for almost 80 percent of the nearly 2,000 slave vessels detained in Atlantic waters in the era of suppression; the United States detained just 68.\n\nWhy such a half-hearted effort? The answer is simple. American administrations were often stocked with Southerners in key positions like secretary of state, secretary of the navy and president, and they refused to take serious action against the foreign slave trade. Thus they tacitly allowed the Stars and Stripes to be used as a cover. In the absence of a treaty the British were reluctant to interfere with American shipping; only American naval ships could stop this practice, and even when they acted officers would usually detain a ship only if slaves were on board (thus ships heading to Africa, even if they were obviously slavers, were let go).\n\nBut an unwillingness to enforce the law was just part of the story. American shipbuilders also sent a steady stream of fast sailing vessels into the slave trade after 1830. The premium on speed had partly to do with voyage mortality risks and the high-value nature of the cargo \u2014 by the 1860s, 500 slaves could fetch close to half a million dollars in Cuba. The design of the slave vessel changed radically between 1800 and the mid-1830s, and the duration of the middle passage to Cuba declined by one third between the 1790s and 1850s. Many of these fast slavers were yachts or clippers made in the United States: Baltimore, in particular, developed a reputation for constructing fast sailing vessels. In all, about one-third of the slave ships sailing after 1810 were built in American ports.\n\nAn unfolding history of the Civil War with photos and articles from the Times archive and ongoing commentary from Disunion contributors.\n\nSecond, the use of the United States flag by slave traders escalated after 1835. In the early years of suppression, the Cuban trade was conducted under the Spanish flag, the traffic to the French Americas under the French flag and the traffic to Brazil under the Portuguese and Brazilian flags. Only a few of these vessels were American, with an American master and crew. But this situation began to change in 1835 when Great Britain and Spain signed a treaty that for the first time specified a range of equipment that could provide grounds for detention. In other words, slavers without slaves on board could be detained. The immediate effect was that slave traders abandoned the Spanish flag, and began to register their vessels as Portuguese, though a growing number sought registration under American colors.\n\nThe British introduced other measures in 1839 and 1845 that extended the so-called equipment clause to Brazilian and Portuguese slave traders, thus increasing reliance on the American flag even further. For a few years a weird set of flags appeared on the African coast, with vessels frequently carrying more than one set of papers, each to be used as required. Many ships flew no flag at all.\n\nThe use of the American flag ended only after the Civil War began. In 1862, with Southern politicians finally gone from national politics, the United States at last signed a treaty with the British providing for mutual right of search on the high seas, an equipment clause and joint Anglo-American joint courts (called Courts of Mixed Commission) for adjudicating detentions. The fact that those courts never heard a single case detracts not at all from their impact.\n\nTrue, the slave trade continued for another five years, but at decreasing annual volumes. More importantly, there were only three recorded voyages under the United States flag after the 1862 convention \u2014 and, we should add, after the execution that same year of Nathaniel Gordon, the only individual to suffer the full penalty of the 1820 Act that made slave trading a capital offense. Compare this to 123 such voyages documented in the five years preceding the 1862 treaty. Secession, and a Union victory in the war that precluded any renewed trading under the Confederate aegis, made all the difference.\n\nJoin Disunion on Facebook \u00bb\n\nDavid Eltis and David Richardson are the authors of the \u201cAtlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.\u201d Mr. Eltis is a professor of history and the principal investigator for the Electronic Slave Trade Database Project at Emory University; he is also the author of \u201cThe Rise of African Slavery in the Americas.\u201d Mr. Richardson is a professor of history and the director of the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation at the University of Hull."], "summary": ["The United States' Civil War contributed to the end of slavery in other countries as well."]}, {"title": ["Jimmy Carter: U.S. one of worst offenders in modern slavery"], "text": ["Former president Jimmy Carter says in a new interview that the United States is the one of the world's worst offenders when it comes to modern-day slavery, saying its slave trade is worse today than it was even in the 1700s.\n\n\"The United States is one of the most culpable countries in ... modern slavery,\" Carter said in an interview on MSNBC's \"Andrea Mitchell Reports.\" \"The slave trade now greatly exceeds anything that happened in the 19th and 18th centuries.\"\n\nThe United States banned the importation of slaves starting in 1808, but slavery itself persisted for another half-century.\n\nCarter said that, of the 29 million people living in bondage, 60,000 of them are in the United States.

But the changes could also carry outsized influence because Texas is a large state \u2014 textbooks sold to other states often carry content tailored to Texas specifications.\n\nOn Thursday, former U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige, a one-time Houston superintendent, said the proposed standards are too detailed and \"take away a lot of the latitude of the teachers\" in designing curricula. He also worries that teachers, focused increasingly on getting their students to pass state skills tests, will be \"very, very concerned about the standards\" and ensure that students learn the content.\n\nPaige testified before the board on Wednesday about the growing politicization of education. In an interview Thursday, he said he understands the point of view of several state board members, who this week said they are simply bringing balance to a set of standards that skew leftward. But Paige said, \"This political swaying between left and right is retarding our ability to have an effective educational delivery system in the United States of America.\"\n\nPaige, who is African-American, said the proposed Texas standards \"drastically understate the influence of slavery and the Civil Rights movement in our national story \u2013 it almost suggests that students will be learning that our liberties \u2013 and especially African-Americans' freedoms \u2013 were kind of gently acquired.

Most Muslims are peaceful and are ashamed of the actions of an extreme small percentage who are misguidedly carrying out terrorism in the name of Islam. Most Muslims do not consider these people true Muslims. Is it easier for you to ignore these facts so you could spread your bigotry and intolerance?\n\nDespite a number of (deliberately?) mitigating biases, both methodological and interpretative, the latest Pew Research Forum report, \"The World's Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society,\" released April 30, 2013, confirms the broad appeal of the totalitarian Sharia, Islam's religio-political \"law,\" across Islamdom.\n\nThe data were pooled from surveys conducted between 2008 and 2012, representing, as touted by Pew, \"a total of 39 countries and territories on three continents: Africa, Asia and Europe.\" Collectively, the surveys included \"more than 38,000 face-to-face interviews in 80-plus languages and dialects, covering every country that has more than 10 million Muslims.\" Pew did acknowledge this important caveat about Muslim populations not surveyed because, \"political sensitivities or security concerns prevented opinion research among Muslims.\" Notably excluded countries were Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, and Iran -- all Islamic states, governed by the Sharia, Saudi Arabia and the Sudan under Sunni Islam, the third, Iran, being the world's largest Shiite Muslim state.\n\nResponses to four related questions on the Sharia, comprise the surveys' salient -- and pathognomonic -- findings. The questions were, \"Do you favor or oppose making sharia law, or Islamic law, the official law of the land in our country?\", and these three internally validating (and equally edifying) queries, \"Do you favor or oppose the following: punishments like whippings and cutting off of hands for crimes like theft and robbery?\", \"Do you favor or oppose the following: punishments like whippings and cutting off of hands for crimes like theft and robbery?\", \"Do you favor or oppose the following: the death penalty for people who leave the Muslim religion?\" Summary data from the nations with the five largest Muslim populations (as per 2010) surveyed, Indonesia (204 million), Pakistan (178 million), Bengladesh (149 million), Egypt (80 million), and Nigeria (76 million), revealed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 72% of Indonesian Muslims, 84% of Pakistani Muslims, 82% of Bengladeshi Muslims, 74% of Egyptian Muslims, and 71% of Nigerian Muslims supported making Sharia the official state law of their respective societies. The population-weighted average from these 5 countries was 77% supportive. (Composite regional data confirmed these individual country trends -- 84% of South Asian Muslims, 77% of Southeast Asian Muslims, 74% of Middle Eastern/North African Muslims, and 64% of Sub-Saharan African Muslims favored application of the Sharia as official state law.)\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 37% of Indonesian Muslims, 85% of Pakistani Muslims, 50% of Bengladeshi Muslims, 70% of Egyptian Muslims, and 45% of Nigerian Muslims favored Sharia-based mandatory (\"hadd\") punishments \"like whippings and cutting off of hands for crimes like theft and robbery\"\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 42% of Indonesian Muslims, 86% of Pakistani Muslims, 54% of Bengladeshi Muslims, 80% of Egyptian Muslims, and 37% of Nigerian Muslims favored the Sharia-based hadd punishment of stoning for adultery\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 16% of Indonesian Muslims, 75% of Pakistani Muslims, 43% of Bengladeshi Muslims, 88% of Egyptian Muslims, and 29% of Nigerian Muslims favored the Sharia-based hadd punishment of execution for \"apostasy\"\n\nFurthermore, the Pew survey results confirm the abject failure of the U.S. midwifed Iraqi and Afghan \"democracies\" to fulfill the utopian aspirations of the much ballyhooed \"(Bernard) Lewis doctrine.\" Instead, the negative prognostications, epitomized by my colleague Diana West's evocative description \"Making the world safe for Sharia,\" have been realized. Specifically, the Pew data indicated:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 91% of Iraqi Muslims and 99% of Afghan Muslims supported making Sharia the official state law of their respective societies\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 55% of Iraqi Muslims and 81% of Afghan Muslims favored Sharia-based hadd punishments \"like whippings and cutting off of hands for crimes like theft and robbery\"\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 57% of Iraqi Muslims and 84% of Afghan Muslims favored the Sharia-based hadd punishment of stoning for adultery\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 42% of Iraqi Muslims and 79% of Afghan Muslims favored the Sharia-based hadd punishment of execution for \"apostasy\"\n\nReligious piety, as evidenced by frequency of prayer and \"Following the Prophet's Example,\" increased support for Sharia, which was unaffected by age, gender, or educational level.\n\nThe Pew report fails to elaborate on these strong associations, offering no explanation about why increased compliance with prayer and pious conformity with the behavior of Islam's prophet Muhammad might result in broad Muslim approval for mutilating thieves, stoning adulterers to death, or executing those who simply exercise freedom of conscience and forsake Islam. Yet the Pew investigators readily proffer these mollifying comments, insisting the predilection for Sharia \"varies widely,\" noting \"many favor democracy over authoritarian rule,\" and even concluding,\n\nOverall, Muslims broadly support the idea of religious freedom. Among Muslims who say people of different religions are very free to practice their faith, three-quarters or more in each country say this is a good thing.\n\nFirst, even the Pew data on Muslim support for \"killing\" apostates do not reflect sentiments for the less draconian punishments for apostasy: imprisonment with beatings (for women under Shiite law, timed to each of the prayer sessions, i.e., 5 times per day) until \"recantation\"; dissolution of marriage and both parental and property rights. These adjunct non-lethal \"punishments\" -- often applied to \"private\" apostates who do not manifest their apostasy in public -- would likely have registered far more \"popular\" appeal. Also, both \"religious freedom\" and \"freedom\" -- (\"hurriyya\"; discussed below) in Islamdom bear no resemblance to Western conceptions of these ideals, as this ranking of Christian persecution -- dominated by countries from sub-Saharan Africa (where 94% affirmed to Pew \"it is good that others are very free to practice their faith\" ) and the Middle East/North Africa (where 85% affirmed to Pew \"it is good that others are very free to practice their faith\") -- makes plain.\n\nFurthermore, the current Pew report includes no data on \"blasphemy,\" i.e., a simple question about Muslim attitudes toward public criticism of Islam's prophet or the creed itself by both non-Muslims and Muslims, ignoring Pew's own August, 2011 data from its analysis, \"Rising Restrictions on Religion.\" This report, released August 9, 2011, examined the issue of \"defamation\" of religion, tracking countries where various blasphemy, or criticism of religions are enforced. \"While such laws are sometimes promoted as a way to protect religion, in practice, they often serve to punish religious minorities whose beliefs are deemed unorthodox or heretical,\" the report noted. These Pew findings indicated that application of the Sharia at present resulted in a disproportionate number of Muslim countries, twenty-one -- Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Brunei, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Western Sahara, and Yemen --registering the highest (i.e., worst) persecution scores on their scale. Furthermore, the Pew investigators observed,\n\nEight-in-ten countries in the Middle East-North Africa region have laws against blasphemy, apostasy or defamation of religion, the highest share of any region. These penalties are enforced in 60% of the countries in the region.\n\nAs a predictable consequence of this Sharia-based application of apostasy and blasphemy laws by Islamic governments, the Pew report also documented that\n\n...the share of national governments that showed hostility toward minority religions involving physical violence was much higher in countries where laws against blasphemy, apostasy or defamation of religion are actively enforced than in countries without such laws (55% versus 22%).\n\nPew's reticence to present its own April 2013 findings without clumsily recasting, or ignoring their doctrinal roots, with obvious implications, can be traced to the dominant, post-modern Western narrative regarding Islam, where objective understanding has been replaced by pure apologetics. Indeed, simply presenting doctrinal Sharia without camouflage, and then demonstrating how Muslims, overwhelmingly, continue to cherish the application of this ancient system of religious totalitarianism, shatters the prevailing, rigidly enforced Western apologetic narrative.\n\nDerived from Islam's most important canonical texts -- the Koran and hadith (the canonical collections of the Muslim prophet Muhammad's deeds and pronouncements) -- and their interpretation and codification by Islam's greatest classical legists, Sharia, is not merely holistic, in the general sense of all-encompassing, but totalitarian, regulating everything from the ritual aspects of religion to personal hygiene to the governance of a Muslim minority community or an Islamic state, bloc of states, or global Islamic order. Clearly, this latter political aspect is the most troubling, being an ancient antecedent of more familiar modern totalitarian systems. Specifically, Sharia's liberty-crushing and dehumanizing political aspects feature open-ended jihadism to subjugate the world to a totalitarian Islamic order; rejection of bedrock Western liberties -- including freedom of conscience and speech -- enforced by imprisonment, beating, or death; discriminatory relegation of non-Muslims to outcast, vulnerable pariahs, and of even Muslim women, to subservient chattel; and barbaric, mandatory \"hadd\" punishments which violate human dignity, such as amputation for theft, stoning for adultery, and lashing for alcohol consumption.\n\nHere is an apt illustration (via Andrew McCarthy's summary) of the contents of Reliance of the Traveller, a classic Sharia manual of Islamic jurisprudence, certified by Al Azhar University, the Vatican of Sunni Islamic religious education, as conforming \"to the practice and faith of the orthodox Sunni Community,\" in our era:\n\n- Apostasy from Islam is \"the ugliest form of unbelief\" for which the penalty is death (\"When a person who has reached puberty and is sane voluntarily apostatizes from Islam, he deserves to be killed\")\n\n- Apostasy occurs not only when a Muslim renounces Islam but also, among other things, when a Muslim appears to worship an idol, when he is heard \"to speak words that imply unbelief,\" when he makes statements that appear to deny or revile Allah or the prophet Mohammed, when he is heard \"to deny the obligatory character of something which by consensus of Muslims is part of Islam,\" and when he is heard \"to be sarcastic about any ruling of the Sacred Law\"\n\n- \"Jihad means to war against non-Muslims\"\n\n- Non-Muslims are permitted to live in an Islamic state only if they follow the rules of Islam, pay the non-Muslim poll tax, and comply with various adhesive conditions designed to remind them that they have been subdued (such as wearing distinctive clothing, keeping to one side of the street, not being greeted with \"Peace be with you\" (\"as-Salamu alaykum\"), not being permitted to build as high as or higher than Muslims, and being forbidden to build new churches, recite prayers aloud, \"or make public displays of their funerals or feastdays\"\n\n- Offenses committed against Muslims (including murder) are more serious than offenses committed against non-Muslims\n\n- The penalty for fornication is to be stoned to death, unless one is without the \"capacity to remain chaste,\" in which case the penalty is \"being scourged one hundred stripes and banished to a distance of at least 81 km./50mi. for one year\"\n\n- The penalty for homosexual activity (\"sodomy and lesbianism\") is death\n\n- \"Circumcision is obligatory (for every male and female) by cutting off the piece of skin on the glans of the penis of the male, but circumcision of the female is by cutting out the clitoris\"\n\n- A Muslim woman may only marry a Muslim man; a Muslim man may marry up to four women, who may be Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (but no apostates from Islam)\n\n- A woman is required to be obedient to her husband and is prohibited from leaving the marital home without permission; if permitted to go out, she must conceal her figure or alter it \"to a form unlikely to draw looks from men or attract them\"\n\n- A non-Muslim may not be awarded custody of a Muslim child\n\n- The penalty for theft is amputation of the right hand\n\n- The penalty for drinking alcohol is \"to be scourged forty stripes\"\n\n- The penalty for accepting interest (\"usurious gain\") is death (i.e., to be considered in a state of war against Allah)\n\n- The testimony of a woman is worth half that of a man\n\n- If a case involves an allegation of fornication (including rape), \"then it requires four male witnesses\"\n\n- The establishment of a caliphate is obligatory, and the caliph must be Muslim and male\n\nBut Pew's investigators, and journalists reporting the Pew survey results were puzzled by the seeming \"contradiction\" between the Muslim desire for Sharia, including application of the hadd punishments, and professions of support for \"freedom,\" including \"religious freedom,\" and \"democracy,\" or even so-called \"anti-authoritarianism.\" The Economist's lament characterized this apparent \"confused\" state of mind as follows:\n\nAlmost 80% of Egyptian Muslims say they favour religious freedom and a similar number favour sharia law. Of that group, almost 90% also think people who renounce Islam should be put to death. Confused? So are they.\n\nThese inept assessments reveal an ignorant or willfully blind misunderstanding of the yawning gap between Western and Islamic conceptions of freedom -- \"hurriyya\" in Arabic. Following Sharia slavishly throughout one's life was paramount to hurriyya \"freedom.\" This earlier more concrete characterization of hurriyya's metaphysical meaning, whose essence Ibn Arabi reiterated, was pronounced by the Sufi scholar al-Qushayri (d. 1072/74).\n\nLet it be known to you that the real meaning of freedom lies in the perfection of slavery. If the slavery of a human being in relation to God is a true one, his freedom is relieved from the yoke of changes. Anyone who imagines that it may be granted to a human being to give up his slavery for a moment and disregard the commands and prohibitions of the religious law while possessing discretion and responsibility, has divested himself of Islam. God said to his Prophet: \"And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death).\" (Koran 15:99). As agreed upon by the [Koranic] commentators, \"certainty\" here means the end (of life).\n\nBernard Lewis, in his (mid-1950s) Encyclopedia of Islam analysis of hurriyya, discusses this concept in the latter phases of the Ottoman Empire through the contemporary era. After highlighting a few \"cautious\" or \"conservative\" (Lewis' characterization) reformers and their writings, Lewis maintains:\n\n[T]here is still no idea that the subjects have any right to share in the formation or conduct of government -- to political freedom, or citizenship, in the sense which underlies the development of political thought in the West. While conservative reformers talked of freedom under law, and some Muslim rulers even experimented with councils and assemblies government was in fact becoming more and not less arbitrary[.]\n\nLewis also makes the important point that Western colonialism ameliorated this chronic situation:\n\nDuring the period of British and French domination, individual freedom was never much of an issue. Though often limited and sometimes suspended, it was on the whole more extensive and better protected than either before or after.\n\nAnd Lewis concludes his entry by observing that Islamic societies forsook even their inchoate democratic experiments:\n\nIn the final revulsion against the West, Western democracy too was rejected as a fraud and a delusion, of no value to Muslims.\n\nElsewhere, writing contemporaneously (in 1958) on democratic institutions in the Islamic Middle East, Lewis conceded that at least \"equality and fraternity\" between Muslims were accepted. But even here Lewis included a major caveat with regard to \"liberty,\" whose Islamic formulation might never resemble John Stuart Mill's conception in On Liberty. Lewis featured a reference to Alice in Wonderland, making plain his assessment of the likely superficial (at best) outcome of Muslim democratization efforts:\n\n...perhaps it may be possible to extend them beyond it [the Muslim community] adding a redefined liberty [emphasis added], to make a new kind of democracy. Only \"the question is\" as Alice remarked, \"whether you can [emphasis in original] make words mean so many different things.\"\n\nThree decades later, Johannes J.G. Jansen, the great contemporary Dutch scholar of Islam, in his seminal 1986 study, The Neglected Duty: The Creed of Sadat's Assassins and Islamic Resurgence in the Middle East, highlighted the conundrum accurate depiction of these sacralized Muslim dogmas -- and their undiminished popularity -- created for Western Islamic apologists in the media and the academy:\n\nWestern journalists or scholars picture Islam as a system that is open-minded, liberal, vague, and humanist as their own Western systems. . . . Western writers who give accounts of Islam to a Western public often do not stress those elements in Islam that would be offensive or nonsense in the eyes of their Western readers. They rather see it as their duty to present Islam in as acceptable a light as possible to the West. . . . In general, they take on the role of counsel for the defense. . . . Two characteristics of Islam are particularly offensive to the general Western reader: its totalitarian claim to universal validity and its theocratic demands. . . . The smallest details of daily life are subject to the provisions of Islamic law, not excluding personal hygiene and metabolism. Muslims, it is well known, identify all prescripts of Islamic Law totally and vehemently with the Command of God...To many, moreover, it is not immediately obvious that the rule of Islamic Law [Sharia] of the land implies the use of force in order to implement a religion, namely Islam, since no state can exist if it rejects the use of force to compel the observance of its laws. Once this is clear, ques-tions about the status of lax Muslims, of non-Muslims, and of ex-Muslims who live in Muslim territory inevitably arise. Since Muslims themselves are not at all embarrassed by the political aspirations of their religion they fail to see why others should be.\n\n[I]t will not easily occur to the general Western reader that most Muslims -- not only those the West calls fundamentalists -- welcome the establishment of an Islamic state where the [Sharia], which according the Muslims, were given by God, are universally applied.\n\nValidating Jansen's concluding observation about mass, rank-in-file Muslim support for state application of the Sharia, Ma'ruf Amin, the chairman of the Indonesian Council of Ulema [Muslim religious leaders], celebrated Pew's 2013 report, opining,\n\nMost of the country's population are Muslims, so I think it represents the desires of most Indonesians to have more Shariah Law.\n\nAmin added that if the Indonesian Muslims desired Sharia, their vox populi wishes should become government policy.\n\nFinally, the Pew report takes great pains to dissociate the sentiments of the American Muslim community from those of the global Muslim umma by narrowing down this alleged difference, most pointedly, to the fact that 81% of U.S. Muslims \"firmly\" rejected homicide bombing \"to defend Islam from its enemies.\" (13% found justification for such acts, while 6% didn't know or refused to answer.)\n\nCuriously (or self-servingly), however, Pew offered no comparison data regarding U.S. Muslim attitudes towards application of the Sharia, either in whole, or part. Notwithstanding Pew's inattention to this critical matter, the results of polling data collected by Wenzel Strategies during October 22 to 26, 2012, from 600 U.S. Muslims (i.e., a sample characterized by high socio-economic status), indicated widespread support among American votaries of Islam for Sharia-based rejection of freedom expression, as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. (The First Amendment states, plainly, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\") When asked, \"Do you believe that criticism of Islam or Muhammad should be permitted under the Constitution's First Amendment?, 58% replied \"no,\" while only 42% affirmed this most basic manifestation of freedom of speech, i.e., to criticize religious, or any other dogma. Indeed, oblivious to US constitutional law, as opposed to Islam's Sharia, a largely concordant 45% of respondents agreed \"...that those who criticize or parody Islam in the U.S. should face criminal charges,\" while 38% did not, and 17% were \"unsure\". Moreover, fully 12% of this Muslim sample even admitted they believed in application of the draconian, Sharia-based punishment for the non-existent crime of \"blasphemy\" in the US code, answering affirmatively, \"...that Americans who criticize or parody Islam should be put to death.\" Also, consistent with such findings 43% of these U.S. Muslims rejected the right of members of other faiths to proselytize to adherents of Islam, disagreeing, \"...that U.S. citizens have a right to evangelize Muslims to consider other faiths.\" Additional confirmatory data revealed that nearly two-fifths (39%) agreed \"...that Shariah law should be considered when adjudicating cases that involve Muslims, \" while nearly one-third (32%) of this American Muslim sample believed \"...Shariah law should be the supreme law of the land in the US.\"\n\nIn conclusion, these observations from a renowned Western anthropologist, and an important Muslim cleric residing in Lebanon's then Westernized, bi-confessional, Muslim-Christian milieu, contextualize the global Islamic trends revealed by the April, 2013 Pew data.\n\nErnest Gellner (1925-1995), was a British-Czech philosopher and social anthropologist. His anthropological interests extended to Islamdom, notably the 1981 study Muslim Society. In 1995, an obituarist described Gellner as a \"defender of positivism, empiricism and rationalism,\" who, \"with cold clarity\" and \"sternness\" critiqued \"religious and leftist seekers after umma . . . linguistic philosophy, relativism, psychoanalysis, and post-modernism.\" Gellner wrote in 1991,\n\nI think it is fair to say that no secularization has taken place in the world of Islam: that the hold of Islam over its believers is as strong, and in some ways stronger, now than it was 100 years ago. Somehow or other Islam is secularization-resistant, and the striking thing is that this remains true under a whole range of political regimes. It is true under socially radical regimes which try to fuse Islam with socialist terminology and ideas; it is equally true under traditionalist regimes whose elites belong to the world of Ibn Khaldun and come from a ruling tribal network; and it is true of the regimes in between.\n\nHusayn Al-Quwatli (fl. 1975), was a director general of Dar al-Ifta, the center of spiritual authority for the Sunni community of Lebanon, and author of the treatise, \"Islam, the State, and Secularism\" (1975). The following statement by Husayn al-Quwatli appeared in the Lebanese publications Al-Safir August 18, 1975, and Al-Amal, October 9, 1975, at the outset of Lebanon's civil war.\n\nThe position of Islam is very clear on one point, namely that the true Muslim cannot take a disinterested position vis-\u00c3 -vis the state. As a result, his position with regard to ruler and rule cannot be an indecisive one which is content with half solutions. Either the ruler is Muslim and the rule Islamic, then he will be content with the state and support it, or the ruler non-Muslim and the rule non-Islamic, then he rejects it, opposes it, and works to abolish it, gently or forcibly, openly or secretly."], "summary": ["YANGON, Myanmar --\u00a0A monk has been dubbed the"]}, {"title": ["KING: Small groups of bigoted people spark world's tragedies"], "text": ["If you\u2019ve ever studied apartheid in South Africa, segregation in Jim Crow America, the wholesale extermination of the indigenous American Indians, genocide in Rwanda, the Holocaust in Europe or the trans-Atlantic slave trade throughout the world, you must know that each and every one of those horrific periods in human history, did not happen suddenly, but after a period of what I will call \u201cothering\u201d in which entire groups of people are portrayed as uncivilized, barbaric, dangerous, and less than fully human.\n\nMore than any point in my lifetime, we are witnessing the mainstream \u201cothering\u201d of tens of millions of men, women, and children who call America home.\n\nTRUMP HAS NO REGRET ON PLAN TO BLOCK MUSLIMS\n\nGenocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, lynching, slavery and segregation were not conceived on Monday and launched on Tuesday. Before they began, they started out with a relatively small percentage of people who held bigoted views on a particular people group. Next, that relatively small group of bigoted people began to grow \u2014 first into thousands, then tens of thousands and, eventually, millions of people who saw themselves, in one way or another, as better than another group.\n\nEventually, in each of those man-made disasters, bigotry jumped the fence from being personal and philosophical ideas to political positions backed up by military action, legislative proposals, or business endeavors.\n\nIn essence, in all of the above cases, bigotry eventually became institutional and mainstream.\n\nIt was at that critical inflection point where the concept that Jewish people were somehow dangerous devolved into a full-fledged policy in which millions upon millions of European Jewish men, women, and children were rounded up, herded like cattle to concentration camps, and slaughtered by the millions. Before Jews were exterminated in Europe, they were banned from government jobs, stripped of their right to vote, and eventually forced to carry identifications marking them as Jewish. This \u201cothering\u201d is what paved the way for mass murder. Many who experienced this horror are still alive today.\n\nWhen bigotry became policy in the United States, the Three-Fifths Compromise became law and stated that Africans in America, who at that time were almost exclusively viewed as property, should only be counted as 60% human.\n\nBefore that compromise was struck, over 1.5 million Africans died aboard slave ships crossing the Atlantic ocean. Treated as perishable cargo instead of precious human beings, millions upon millions of Africans, seen as subhuman savages good only for forced labor, were shipped all over the world, against their will, to be permanent slaves.

Soon he declared that he would \u201cround up\u201d over 400,000 undocumented Mexican immigrants per month for 24 months and drop them off at an undisclosed location in Mexico. With stadiums and crowds coming out to hear Trump all across America, he seemed to find his sweet spot in a new form of white supremacy that degraded Mexicans, stereotyped African Americans and banned Muslims.\n\nTrump, though, is not alone in his bigotry. After the terrorist attacks in Paris, in which zero Syrians and zero refugees took place, over 30 governors from all over the United States moved to sign executive orders halting the immigration of Syrian refugees into their states. House Speaker Paul Ryan and a rather bi-partisan group of representatives soon voted and approved their own bill halting Syrian refugees from entering the United States. It was all rushed and done urgently in the name of national security.\n\nThis, too, was a form of othering.

A native of Kingston upon Hull , Yorkshire , he began his political career in 1780 , eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire ( 1784 \u2013 1812 ) . In 1785 , he became an Evangelical Christian , which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform . In 1787 , he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti @-@ slave @-@ trade activists , including Granville Sharp , Hannah More and Charles Middleton . They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition , and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists . He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807 . Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion , morality and education . He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice , British missionary work in India , the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone , the foundation of the Church Mission Society , and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation , and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad . In later years , Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery , and continued his involvement after 1826 , when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health . That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 , which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire ; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured . He was buried in Westminster Abbey , close to his friend William Pitt . Wilberforce was born in a house on the High Street of Hull , in the East Riding of Yorkshire : England , on 24 August 1759 , the only son of Robert Wilberforce ( 1728 \u2013 68 ) , a wealthy merchant , and his wife Elizabeth Bird ( 1730 \u2013 98 ) . His grandfather William ( 1690 \u2013 1774 or 1776 ) had made the family fortune in the maritime trade with Baltic countries , and had twice been elected mayor of Hull . Wilberforce was a small , sickly and delicate child , with poor eyesight . In 1767 he began attending Hull Grammar School , at the time headed by a young , dynamic headmaster , Joseph Milner , who was to become a lifelong friend . Wilberforce profited from the supportive atmosphere at the school until the death of his father in 1768 . With his mother struggling to cope , the nine @-@ year @-@ old Wilberforce was sent to a prosperous uncle and aunt with houses in both St James ' Place , London , and Wimbledon , at that time a village 7 miles ( 11 km ) south @-@ west of London . He attended an \" indifferent \" boarding school in Putney for two years , spending his holidays in Wimbledon , where he grew extremely fond of his relatives . He became interested in evangelical Christianity because of their influence , especially that of his aunt Hannah , sister of the wealthy Christian merchant John Thornton , a philanthropist and a supporter of the leading Methodist preacher George Whitefield . Wilberforce 's staunchly Church of England mother and grandfather , alarmed at these nonconformist influences and at his leanings towards evangelicalism , brought the 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy back to Hull in 1771 . Wilberforce was heartbroken to be separated from his aunt and uncle . His family opposed a return to Hull Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist ; Wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby Pocklington School from 1771 to 1776 . Influenced by Methodist scruples , he initially resisted Hull 's lively social life , but as his religious fervour diminished , he embraced theatre @-@ going , attended balls and played cards . In October 1776 , at the age of 17 , Wilberforce went up to St John 's College , Cambridge . The deaths of his grandfather and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy , and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study . Instead , he immersed himself in the social round of student life , and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards , gambling and late @-@ night drinking sessions \u2014 although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful . Witty , generous , and an excellent conversationalist , Wilberforce was a popular figure . He made many friends , including the more studious future Prime Minister , William Pitt . Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying , he managed to pass his examinations , and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788 . Wilberforce began to consider a political career while still at university , and during the winter of 1779 \u2013 80 , he and Pitt frequently watched House of Commons debates from the gallery . Pitt , already set on a political career , encouraged Wilberforce to join him in obtaining a parliamentary seat . In September 1780 , at the age of twenty @-@ one and while still a student , Wilberforce was elected Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Kingston upon Hull , spending over \u00a3 8 @,@ 000 to ensure he received the necessary votes , as was the custom of the time . Free from financial pressures , Wilberforce sat as an independent , resolving to be \" no party man \" . Criticised at times for inconsistency , he supported both Tory and Whig governments according to his conscience , working closely with the party in power , and voting on specific measures according to their merits . Wilberforce attended Parliament regularly , but he also maintained a lively social life , becoming an habitu\u00e9 of gentlemen 's gambling clubs such as <unk> 's and Boodle 's in Pall Mall , London . The writer and socialite Madame de Sta\u00ebl described him as the \" wittiest man in England \" and , according to Georgiana , Duchess of Devonshire , the Prince of Wales said that he would go anywhere to hear Wilberforce sing . Wilberforce used his speaking voice to great effect in political speeches ; the diarist and author James Boswell witnessed Wilberforce 's eloquence in the House of Commons and noted , \" I saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table ; but as I listened , he grew , and grew , until the shrimp became a whale . \" During the frequent government changes of 1781 \u2013 84 , Wilberforce supported his friend Pitt in parliamentary debates . In autumn 1783 , Pitt , Wilberforce and Edward Eliot ( later to become Pitt 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ) , travelled to France for a six @-@ week holiday together . After a difficult start in Rheims , where their presence aroused police suspicion that they were English spies , they visited Paris , meeting Benjamin Franklin , General Lafayette , Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI , and joined the French court at Fontainebleau . Pitt became Prime Minister in December 1783 , with Wilberforce a key supporter of his minority government . Despite their close friendship , there is no record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments . This may have been due to Wilberforce 's wish to remain an independent MP . Alternatively , Wilberforce 's frequent tardiness and disorganisation , as well as the chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible , may have convinced Pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material . When Parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784 , Wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for the county of Yorkshire in the 1784 general election . On 6 April , he was returned as MP for Yorkshire at the age of twenty @-@ four . In October 1784 , Wilberforce embarked upon a tour of Europe which would ultimately change his life and determine his future career . He travelled with his mother and sister in the company of Isaac Milner , the brilliant younger brother of his former headmaster , who had been Fellow of Queens ' College , Cambridge , in the year when Wilberforce first went up . They visited the French Riviera and enjoyed the usual pastimes of dinners , cards , and gambling . In February 1785 , Wilberforce returned to the United Kingdom temporarily , to support Pitt 's proposals for parliamentary reforms . He rejoined the party in Genoa , Italy , from where they continued their tour to Switzerland . Milner accompanied Wilberforce to England , and on the journey they read The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul by Philip Doddridge , a leading early 18th @-@ century English nonconformist . Wilberforce 's spiritual journey is thought to have begun at this time . He started to rise early to read the Bible and pray and kept a private journal . He underwent an evangelical conversion , regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of God . His conversion changed some of his habits , but not his nature : he remained outwardly cheerful , interested and respectful , tactfully urging others towards his new faith . <unk> , he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self @-@ critical , harshly judging his spirituality , use of time , vanity , self @-@ control and relationships with others . At the time , religious enthusiasm was generally regarded as a social transgression and was stigmatised in polite society . Evangelicals in the upper classes , such as Sir Richard Hill , the Methodist MP for Shropshire , and Selina Hastings , Countess of Huntingdon , were exposed to contempt and ridicule , and Wilberforce 's conversion led him to question whether he should remain in public life . He sought guidance from John Newton , a leading Evangelical Anglican clergyman of the day and Rector of St Mary Woolnoth in the City of London . Both Newton and Pitt counselled him to remain in politics , and he resolved to do so \" with increased diligence and conscientiousness \" . Thereafter , his political views were informed by his faith and by his desire to promote Christianity and Christian ethics in private and public life . His views were often deeply conservative , opposed to radical changes in a God @-@ given political and social order , and focused on issues such as the observance of the Sabbath and the eradication of immorality through education and reform . As a result , he was often distrusted by progressive voices because of his conservatism , and regarded with suspicion by many Tories who saw Evangelicals as radicals , bent on the overthrow of church and state . In 1786 , Wilberforce leased a house in Old Palace Yard , Westminster , in order to be near Parliament . He began using his parliamentary position to advocate reform by introducing a Registration Bill , proposing limited changes to parliamentary election procedures . He brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists , arsonists and thieves . The bill also advocated the reduction of sentences for women convicted of treason , a crime that at the time included a husband 's murder . The House of Commons passed both bills , but they were defeated in the House of Lords . The British initially became involved in the slave trade during the 16th century . By 1783 , the triangular route that took British @-@ made goods to Africa to buy slaves , transported the enslaved to the West Indies , and then brought slave @-@ grown products such as sugar , tobacco , and cotton to Britain , represented about 80 percent of Great Britain 's foreign income . British ships dominated the trade , supplying French , Spanish , Dutch , Portuguese and British colonies , and in peak years carried forty thousand enslaved men , women and children across the Atlantic in the horrific conditions of the middle passage . Of the estimated 11 million Africans transported into slavery , about 1 @.@ 4 million died during the voyage . The British campaign to abolish the slave trade is generally considered to have begun in the 1780s with the establishment of the Quakers ' antislavery committees , and their presentation to Parliament of the first slave trade petition in 1783 . The same year , Wilberforce , while dining with his old Cambridge friend Gerard Edwards , met Rev. James Ramsay , a ship 's surgeon who had become a clergyman on the island of St Christopher ( later St Kitts ) in the Leeward Islands , and a medical supervisor of the plantations there . What Ramsay had witnessed of the conditions endured by the slaves , both at sea and on the plantations , horrified him . Returning to England after fifteen years , he accepted the living of Teston , Kent in 1781 , and there met Sir Charles Middleton , Lady Middleton , Thomas Clarkson , Hannah More and others , a group that later became known as the <unk> . Interested in promoting Christianity and moral improvement in Britain and overseas , they were appalled by Ramsay 's reports of the depraved lifestyles of slave owners , the cruel treatment meted out to the enslaved , and the lack of Christian instruction provided to the slaves . With their encouragement and help , Ramsay spent three years writing An essay on the treatment and conversion of African slaves in the British sugar colonies , which was highly critical of slavery in the West Indies . The book , published in 1784 , was to have an important impact in raising public awareness and interest , and it excited the ire of West Indian planters who in the coming years attacked both Ramsay and his ideas in a series of pro @-@ slavery tracts . Wilberforce apparently did not follow up on his meeting with Ramsay . However , three years later , and inspired by his new faith , Wilberforce was growing interested in humanitarian reform . In November 1786 , he received a letter from Sir Charles Middleton that re @-@ opened his interest in the slave trade . At the urging of Lady Middleton , Sir Charles suggested that Wilberforce bring forward the abolition of the slave trade in Parliament . Wilberforce responded that he \" felt the great importance of the subject , and thought himself unequal to the task allotted to him , but yet would not positively decline it \" . He began to read widely on the subject , and met with the <unk> at Middleton 's home at Barham Court in Teston in the early winter of 1786 \u2013 87 . In early 1787 , Thomas Clarkson , a fellow graduate of St John 's , Cambridge , who had become convinced of the need to end the slave trade after writing a prize @-@ winning essay on the subject while at Cambridge , called upon Wilberforce at Old Palace Yard with a published copy of the work . This was the first time the two men had met ; their collaboration would last nearly fifty years . Clarkson began to visit Wilberforce on a weekly basis , bringing first @-@ hand evidence he had obtained about the slave trade . The Quakers , already working for abolition , also recognised the need for influence within Parliament , and urged Clarkson to secure a commitment from Wilberforce to bring forward the case for abolition in the House of Commons . It was arranged that Bennet Langton , a Lincolnshire landowner and mutual acquaintance of Wilberforce and Clarkson , would organize a dinner party in order to ask Wilberforce formally to lead the parliamentary campaign . The dinner took place on 13 March 1787 ; other guests included Charles Middleton , Sir Joshua Reynolds , William Windham , MP , James Boswell and Isaac Hawkins Browne , MP . By the end of the evening , Wilberforce had agreed in general terms that he would bring forward the abolition of the slave trade in Parliament , \" provided that no person more proper could be found \" . The same spring , on 12 May 1787 , the still hesitant Wilberforce held a conversation with William Pitt and the future Prime Minister William Grenville as they sat under a large oak tree on Pitt 's estate in Kent . Under what came to be known as the \" Wilberforce Oak \" at <unk> , Pitt challenged his friend : \" Wilberforce , why don 't you give notice of a motion on the subject of the Slave Trade ? You have already taken great pains to collect evidence , and are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will ensure you . Do not lose time , or the ground will be occupied by another . \" Wilberforce 's response is not recorded , but he later declared in old age that he could \" distinctly remember the very knoll on which I was sitting near Pitt and Grenville \" where he made his decision . Wilberforce 's involvement in the abolition movement was motivated by a desire to put his Christian principles into action and to serve God in public life . He and other Evangelicals were horrified by what they perceived was a depraved and unchristian trade , and the greed and avarice of the owners and traders . Wilberforce sensed a call from God , writing in a journal entry in 1787 that \" God Almighty has set before me two great objects , the suppression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners [ moral values ] \" . The conspicuous involvement of Evangelicals in the highly popular anti @-@ slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality . On 22 May 1787 , the first meeting of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade took place , bringing like @-@ minded British Quakers and Anglicans together in the same organisation for the first time . The committee chose to campaign against the slave trade rather than slavery itself , with many members believing that slavery would eventually disappear as a natural consequence of the abolition of the trade . Wilberforce , though involved informally , did not join the committee officially until 1791 . The society was highly successful in raising public awareness and support , and local chapters sprang up throughout Great Britain . Clarkson travelled the country researching and collecting first @-@ hand testimony and statistics , while the committee promoted the campaign , pioneering techniques such as lobbying , writing pamphlets , holding public meetings , gaining press attention , organising boycotts and even using a campaign logo : an image of a kneeling slave above the motto \" Am I not a Man and a Brother ? \" , designed by the renowned pottery @-@ maker Josiah Wedgwood . The committee also sought to influence slave @-@ trading nations such as France , Spain , Portugal , Denmark , Holland and the United States , corresponding with anti @-@ slavery activists in other countries and organising the translation of English @-@ language books and pamphlets . These included books by former slaves <unk> <unk> and Olaudah Equiano , who had published influential works on slavery and the slave trade in 1787 and 1789 respectively . They and other free blacks , collectively known as \" Sons of Africa \" , spoke at debating societies and wrote spirited letters to newspapers , periodicals and prominent figures , as well as public letters of support to campaign allies . Hundreds of parliamentary petitions opposing the slave trade were received in 1788 and following years , with hundreds of thousands of signatories in total . The campaign proved to be the world 's first grassroots human rights campaign , in which men and women from different social classes and backgrounds volunteered to try to end the injustices suffered by others . Wilberforce had planned to introduce a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session . However , in January 1788 , he was taken ill with a probable stress @-@ related condition , now thought to be ulcerative colitis . It was several months before he was able to resume work , and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge . His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium , which proved effective in alleviating his condition , and which he continued to use for the rest of his life . In Wilberforce 's absence , Pitt , who had long been supportive of abolition , introduced the preparatory motion himself , and ordered a Privy Council investigation into the slave trade , followed by a House of Commons review . With the publication of the Privy Council report in April 1789 and following months of planning , Wilberforce commenced his parliamentary campaign . On 12 May 1789 , he made his first major speech on the subject of abolition in the House of Commons , in which he reasoned that the trade was morally reprehensible and an issue of natural justice . Drawing on Thomas Clarkson 's mass of evidence , he described in detail the appalling conditions in which slaves travelled from Africa in the middle passage , and argued that abolishing the trade would also bring an improvement to the conditions of existing slaves in the West Indies . He moved 12 resolutions condemning the slave trade , but made no reference to the abolition of slavery itself , instead dwelling on the potential for reproduction in the existing slave population should the trade be abolished . With the tide running against them , the opponents of abolition delayed the vote by proposing that the House of Commons hear its own evidence , and Wilberforce , in a move that has subsequently been criticised for prolonging the slave trade , reluctantly agreed . The hearings were not completed by the end of the parliamentary session , and were deferred until the following year . In the meantime , Wilberforce and Clarkson tried unsuccessfully to take advantage of the egalitarian atmosphere of the French Revolution to press for France 's abolition of the trade , which was , in any event , to be abolished in 1794 as a result of the bloody slave revolt in St. Domingue ( later to be known as Haiti ) , although later briefly restored by Napoleon in 1802 . In January 1790 , Wilberforce succeeded in speeding up the hearings by gaining approval for a smaller parliamentary select committee to consider the vast quantity of evidence which had been accumulated . Wilberforce 's house in Old Palace Yard became a centre for the abolitionists ' campaign and a focus for many strategy meetings . Petitioners for other causes also besieged him there , and his ante @-@ room was thronged from an early hour , like \" Noah 's Ark , full of beasts clean and unclean \" , according to Hannah More . Interrupted by a general election in June 1790 , the committee finally finished hearing witnesses , and in April 1791 with a closely reasoned four @-@ hour speech , Wilberforce introduced the first parliamentary bill to abolish the slave trade . However , after two evenings of debate , the bill was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88 , the political climate having swung in a conservative direction in the wake of the French Revolution and in reaction to an increase in radicalism and to slave revolts in the French West Indies . Such was the public hysteria of the time that even Wilberforce himself was suspected by some of being a Jacobin agitator . This was the beginning of a protracted parliamentary campaign , during which Wilberforce 's commitment never wavered , despite frustration and hostility . He was supported in his work by fellow members of the so @-@ called Clapham Sect , among whom was his best friend and cousin Henry Thornton . Holding evangelical Christian convictions , and consequently dubbed \" the Saints \" , the group mainly lived in large houses surrounding the common in Clapham , then a village to the south @-@ west of London . Wilberforce accepted an invitation to share a house with Henry Thornton in 1792 , moving into his own home after Thornton 's marriage in 1796 . The \" Saints \" were an informal community , characterised by considerable intimacy as well as a commitment to practical Christianity and an opposition to slavery . They developed a relaxed family atmosphere , wandering freely in and out of each other 's homes and gardens , and discussing the many religious , social and political topics that engaged them . Pro @-@ slavery advocates claimed that enslaved Africans were lesser human beings who benefited from their bondage . Wilberforce , the Clapham Sect and others were anxious to demonstrate that Africans , and particularly freed slaves , had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade , and that they were capable of sustaining a well @-@ ordered society , trade and cultivation . Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp , they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from the United Kingdom , Nova Scotia and Jamaica , as well as native Africans and some whites . They formed the Sierra Leone Company , with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time . The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms ; the reality was fraught with tension , crop failures , disease , death , war and defections to the slave trade . Initially a commercial venture , the British government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808 . The colony , although troubled at times , was to become a symbol of anti @-@ slavery in which residents , communities and African tribal chiefs , worked together to prevent enslavement at the source , supported by a British naval blockade to stem the region 's slave trade . On 2 April 1792 , Wilberforce again brought a bill calling for abolition . The memorable debate that followed drew contributions from the greatest orators in the house , William Pitt and Charles James Fox , as well as from Wilberforce himself . Lord Melville , as Home Secretary , proposed a compromise solution of so @-@ called \" gradual abolition \" over a number of years . This was passed by 230 to 85 votes , but the compromise was little more than a clever ploy , with the intention of ensuring that total abolition would be delayed indefinitely . On 26 February 1793 , another vote to abolish the slave trade was narrowly defeated by eight votes . The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue , as politicians concentrated on the national crisis and the threat of invasion . The same year , and again in 1794 , Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies . He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities . Growing more alarmed , on 31 December 1794 , Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France , a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt . Abolition continued to be associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with British radical groups , resulting in a decline in public support . In 1795 , the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade ceased to meet , and Clarkson retired in ill @-@ health to the Lake District . However , despite the decreased interest in abolition , Wilberforce continued to introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s . The early years of the 19th century once again saw an increased public interest in abolition . Since Napoleon had reintroduced slavery in the French colonies , support of abolition was no longer perceived as being pro @-@ French . In 1804 , Clarkson resumed his work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again , strengthened with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay , Henry Brougham and James Stephen . In June 1804 , Wilberforce 's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons . However , it was too late in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords . On its reintroduction during the 1805 session , it was defeated , with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it . On this occasion and throughout the campaign , abolition was held back by Wilberforce 's trusting , even credulous nature , and his deferential attitude towards those in power . He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing , and was reluctant to confront them when they did not . Following Pitt 's death in January 1806 , Wilberforce began to collaborate more with the Whigs , especially the abolitionists . He gave general support to the Grenville \u2013 Fox administration , which brought more abolitionists into the cabinet ; Wilberforce and Charles Fox led the campaign in the House of Commons , while Lord Grenville advocated the cause in the House of Lords . A radical change of tactics , which involved the introduction of a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies , was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen . It was a shrewd move , since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war . A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet , and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self @-@ imposed silence , so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill . The approach proved successful , and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed , and received royal assent on 23 May 1806 . Wilberforce and Clarkson had collected a large volume of evidence against the slave trade over the previous two decades , and Wilberforce spent the latter part of 1806 writing A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade , which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists ' case . The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow , and was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806 . Slavery became an election issue , bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons , including former military men who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts . Wilberforce was re @-@ elected as an MP for Yorkshire , after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter , in reality a 400 @-@ page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign . Lord Grenville , the Prime Minister , was determined to introduce an Abolition Bill in the House of Lords , rather than in the House of Commons , taking it through its greatest challenge first . When a final vote was taken , the bill was passed in the House of Lords by a large margin . Sensing a breakthrough that had been long anticipated , Charles Grey moved for a second reading in the Commons on 23 February 1807 . As tributes were made to Wilberforce , whose face streamed with tears , the bill was carried by 283 votes to 16 . Excited supporters suggested taking advantage of the large majority to seek the abolition of slavery itself , but Wilberforce made it clear that total emancipation was not the immediate goal : \" They had for the present no object immediately before them , but that of putting stop directly to the carrying of men in British ships to be sold as slaves . \" The Slave Trade Act received royal assent on 25 March 1807 . In his youth , Wilberforce showed little interest in women , but in his late thirties , twenty @-@ year @-@ old Barbara Ann Spooner ( 1777 \u2013 1847 ) was recommended by his friend Thomas Babington as a potential bride . Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797 , and was immediately smitten ; following an eight @-@ day whirlwind romance , he proposed . Despite the urgings of friends to slow down , the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath , Somerset , on 30 May 1797 . They were devoted to each other , and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health , though she showed little interest in his political activities . They had six children in fewer than ten years : William ( b . 1798 ) , Barbara ( b . 1799 ) , Elizabeth ( b . 1801 ) , Robert Isaac Wilberforce ( b . 1802 ) , Samuel Wilberforce ( b . 1805 ) and Henry William Wilberforce ( b . 1807 ) . Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children . Wilberforce was deeply conservative when it came to challenges to the existing political and social order . He advocated change in society through Christianity and improvement in morals , education and religion , fearing and opposing radical causes and revolution . The radical writer William Cobbett was among those who attacked what they saw as Wilberforce 's hypocrisy in campaigning for better working conditions for slaves while British workers lived in terrible conditions at home . \" Never have you done one single act , in favour of the labourers of this country \" , he wrote . Critics noted Wilberforce 's support of the suspension of habeas corpus in 1795 and his votes for Pitt 's \" <unk> Bills \" , which banned meetings of more than 50 people , allowing speakers to be arrested and imposing harsh penalties on those who attacked the constitution . Wilberforce was opposed to giving workers ' rights to organise into unions , in 1799 speaking in favour of the Combination Act , which suppressed trade union activity throughout the United Kingdom , and calling unions \" a general disease in our society \" . He also opposed an enquiry into the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in which eleven protesters were killed at a political rally demanding reform . Concerned about \" bad men who wished to produce anarchy and confusion \" , he approved of the government 's Six Acts , which further limited public meetings and seditious writings . Wilberforce 's actions led the essayist William Hazlitt to condemn him as one \" who preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages , and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states . \" Wilberforce 's views of women and religion were also conservative . He disapproved of women anti @-@ slavery activists such as Elizabeth <unk> , who organised women 's abolitionist groups in the 1820s , protesting : \" [ F ] or ladies to meet , to publish , to go from house to house stirring up petitions \u2013 these appear to me proceedings unsuited to the female character as delineated in Scripture . \" Wilberforce initially strongly opposed bills for Catholic emancipation , which would have allowed Catholics to become MPs , hold public office and serve in the army , although by 1813 , he had changed his views and spoke in favour of a similar bill . More progressively , Wilberforce advocated legislation to improve the working conditions for chimney @-@ sweeps and textile workers , engaged in prison reform , and supported campaigns to restrict capital punishment and the severe punishments meted out under the Game Laws . He recognised the importance of education in alleviating poverty , and when Hannah More and her sister established Sunday schools for the poor in Somerset and the Mendips , he provided financial and moral support as they faced opposition from landowners and Anglican clergy . From the late 1780s onward , Wilberforce campaigned for limited parliamentary reform , such as the abolition of rotten boroughs and the redistribution of Commons seats to growing towns and cities , though by 1832 , he feared that such measures went too far . With others , Wilberforce founded the world 's first animal welfare organisation , the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( later the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ) . In 1824 , Wilberforce was one of over 30 eminent gentlemen who put their names at the inaugural public meeting to the fledgling National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck , later named the Royal National Lifeboat Institution . He was also opposed to duelling , which he described as the \" disgrace of a Christian society \" and was appalled when his friend Pitt engaged in a duel in 1798 , particularly as it occurred on a Sunday , the Christian day of rest . Wilberforce was generous with his time and money , believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a significant portion of their income to the needy . Yearly , he gave away thousands of pounds , much of it to clergymen to distribute in their parishes . He paid off the debts of others , supported education and missions , and in a year of food shortages , gave to charity more than his own yearly income . He was exceptionally hospitable , and could not bear to sack any of his servants . As a result , his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity . Although he was often months behind in his correspondence , Wilberforce responded to numerous requests for advice or for help in obtaining professorships , military promotions and livings for clergymen , or for the reprieve of death sentences . A supporter of the evangelical wing of the Church of England , Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance would lead to a harmonious , moral society . He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life , making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle @-@ classes of society . To this end , in April 1797 , Wilberforce published A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of <unk> Christians in the Higher and Middle Classes of This Country Contrasted With Real Christianity , on which he had been working since 1793 . This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity , as a response to the moral decline of the nation , illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him . The book proved to be influential and a best @-@ seller by the standards of the day ; 7 @,@ 500 copies were sold within six months , and it was translated into several languages . Wilberforce fostered and supported missionary activity in Britain and abroad . He was a founding member of the Church Missionary Society ( since renamed the Church Mission Society ) and was involved , with other members of the Clapham Sect , in numerous other evangelical and charitable organisations . Horrified by the lack of Christian evangelism in India , Wilberforce used the 1793 renewal of the British East India Company 's charter to propose the addition of clauses requiring the company to provide teachers and chaplains and to commit to the \" religious improvement \" of Indians . The plan was unsuccessful due to lobbying by the directors of the company , who feared that their commercial interests would be damaged . Wilberforce tried again in 1813 , when the charter next came up for renewal . Using petitions , meetings , lobbying and letter writing , he successfully campaigned for changes to the charter . Speaking in favour of the Charter Act 1813 , he criticised the British in India for their hypocrisy and racial prejudice , while also condemning aspects of Hinduism including the caste system , infanticide , polygamy and <unk> . \" Our religion is sublime , pure beneficent \" , he said , \" theirs is mean , licentious and cruel \" . Greatly concerned by what he perceived to be the degeneracy of British society , Wilberforce was also active in matters of moral reform , lobbying against \" the torrent of <unk> that every day makes more rapid advances \" , and considered this issue and the abolition of the slave trade as equally important goals . At the suggestion of Wilberforce and Bishop <unk> , King George III was requested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to issue in 1787 the Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice , as a remedy for the rising tide of immorality . The proclamation commanded the prosecution of those guilty of \" excessive drinking , blasphemy , profane swearing and cursing , lewdness , profanation of the Lord 's Day , and other dissolute , immoral , or disorderly practices \" . Greeted largely with public indifference , Wilberforce sought to increase its impact by mobilising public figures to the cause , and by founding the Society for the Suppression of Vice . This and other societies in which Wilberforce was a prime mover , such as the Proclamation Society , mustered support for the prosecution of those who had been charged with violating relevant laws , including brothel keepers , distributors of pornographic material , and those who did not respect the Sabbath . Years later , the writer and clergyman Sydney Smith criticised Wilberforce for being more interested in the sins of the poor than those of the rich , and suggested that a better name would have been the Society for \" suppressing the vices of persons whose income does not exceed \u00a3 500 per annum \" . The societies were not highly successful in terms of membership and support , although their activities did lead to the imprisonment of Thomas Williams , the London printer of Thomas Paine 's The Age of Reason . Wilberforce 's attempts to legislate against adultery and Sunday newspapers were also in vain ; his involvement and leadership in other , less punitive , approaches were more successful in the long @-@ term , however . By the end of his life , British morals , manners , and sense of social responsibility had increased , paving the way for future changes in societal conventions and attitudes during the Victorian era . The hopes of the abolitionists notwithstanding , slavery did not wither with the end of the slave trade in the British Empire , nor did the living conditions of the enslaved improve . The trade continued , with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade , and with some British ships disregarding the legislation . Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries . In particular , the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808 , and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly . The same year , Wilberforce moved his family from Clapham to a sizeable mansion with a large garden in Kensington Gore , closer to the Houses of Parliament . Never strong , and by 1812 in worsening health , Wilberforce resigned his Yorkshire seat , and became MP for the rotten borough of Bramber in Sussex , a seat with little or no constituency obligations , thus allowing him more time for his family and the causes that interested him . From 1816 Wilberforce introduced a series of bills which would require the compulsory registration of slaves , together with details of their country of origin , permitting the illegal importation of foreign slaves to be detected . Later in the same year he began publicly to denounce slavery itself , though he did not demand immediate emancipation , as \" They had always thought the slaves incapable of liberty at present , but hoped that by degrees a change might take place as the natural result of the abolition . \" In 1820 , after a period of poor health , and with his eyesight failing , Wilberforce took the decision to further limit his public activities , although he became embroiled in unsuccessful mediation attempts between King George IV , and his estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick , who had sought her rights as queen . Nevertheless , Wilberforce still hoped \" to lay a foundation for some future measures for the emancipation of the poor slaves \" , which he believed should come about gradually in stages . Aware that the cause would need younger men to continue the work , in 1821 he asked fellow MP Thomas Fowell Buxton to take over leadership of the campaign in the Commons . As the 1820s wore on , Wilberforce increasingly became a figurehead for the abolitionist movement , although he continued to appear at anti @-@ slavery meetings , welcoming visitors , and maintaining a busy correspondence on the subject . The year 1823 saw the founding of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery ( later the Anti @-@ Slavery Society ) , and the publication of Wilberforce 's 56 @-@ page Appeal to the Religion , Justice and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies . In his treatise , Wilberforce urged that total emancipation was morally and ethically required , and that slavery was a national crime that must be ended by parliamentary legislation to gradually abolish slavery . Members of Parliament did not quickly agree , and government opposition in March 1823 stymied Wilberforce 's call for abolition . On 15 May 1823 , Buxton moved another resolution in Parliament for gradual emancipation . Subsequent debates followed on 16 March and 11 June 1824 in which Wilberforce made his last speeches in the Commons , and which again saw the <unk> outmanoeuvred by the government . Wilberforce 's health was continuing to fail , and he suffered further illnesses in 1824 and 1825 . With his family concerned that his life was endangered , he declined a peerage and resigned his seat in Parliament , leaving the campaign in the hands of others . Thomas Clarkson continued to travel , visiting anti @-@ slavery groups throughout Britain , motivating activists and acting as an ambassador for the anti @-@ slavery cause to other countries , while Buxton pursued the cause of reform in Parliament . Public meetings and petitions demanding emancipation continued , with an increasing number supporting immediate abolition rather than the gradual approach favoured by Wilberforce , Clarkson and their colleagues . In 1826 , Wilberforce moved from his large house in Kensington Gore to Highwood Hill , a more modest property in the countryside of Mill Hill , north of London , where he was soon joined by his son William and family . William had attempted a series of educational and career paths , and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses , which his father repaid in full , despite offers from others to assist . This left Wilberforce with little income , and he was obliged to let his home and spend the rest of his life visiting family members and friends . He continued his support for the anti @-@ slavery cause , including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti @-@ Slavery Society . Wilberforce approved of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs , though he was concerned about the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise . In the event , the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery . In addition , the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion . In 1833 , Wilberforce 's health declined further and he suffered a severe attack of influenza from which he never fully recovered . He made a final anti @-@ slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone , Kent . The following month , the Whig government introduced the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery , formally saluting Wilberforce in the process . On 26 July 1833 , Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed the passing of the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery . The following day he grew much weaker , and he died early on the morning of 29 July at his cousin 's house in Cadogan Place , London . One month later , the House of Lords passed the Slavery Abolition Act , which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire from August 1834 . They voted plantation owners \u00a3 20 million in compensation , giving full emancipation to children younger than six , and instituting a system of apprenticeship requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the British West Indies , South Africa , Mauritius , British Honduras and Canada . Nearly 800 @,@ 000 African slaves were freed , the vast majority in the Caribbean . Wilberforce had requested that he was to be buried with his sister and daughter at Stoke Newington , just north of London . However , the leading members of both Houses of Parliament urged that he be honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey . The family agreed and , on 3 August 1833 , Wilberforce was buried in the north transept , close to his friend William Pitt . The funeral was attended by many Members of Parliament , as well as by members of the public . The pallbearers included the Duke of Gloucester , the Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham and the Speaker of the House of Commons Charles Manners @-@ Sutton . While tributes were paid and Wilberforce was laid to rest , both Houses of Parliament suspended their business as a mark of respect . Five years after his death , sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce published a five @-@ volume biography about their father , and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840 . The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce 's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson . Incensed , Clarkson came out of retirement to write a book refuting their version of events , and the sons eventually made a half @-@ hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography . However , for more than a century , Wilberforce 's role in the campaign dominated the history books . Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce , and have termed it one of history 's great partnerships : without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson , abolition could not have been achieved . As his sons had desired and planned , Wilberforce has long been viewed as a Christian hero , a statesman @-@ saint held up as a role model for putting his faith into action . More broadly , he has also been described as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action . In the 1940s , the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams , who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics , as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline . Williams ' approach strongly influenced historians for much of the latter part of the 20th century . However , more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition , and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals , as well as a recognition of the anti @-@ slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns . Wilberforce 's life and work have been commemorated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere . In Westminster Abbey , a seated statue of Wilberforce by Samuel Joseph was erected in 1840 , bearing an epitaph praising his Christian character and his long labour to abolish the slave trade and slavery itself . In Wilberforce 's home town of Hull , a public subscription in 1834 funded the Wilberforce Monument , a 31 @-@ metre ( 102 ft ) Greek Doric column topped by a statue of Wilberforce , which now stands in the grounds of Hull College near Queen 's Gardens . Wilberforce 's birthplace was acquired by the city corporation in 1903 and , following renovation , Wilberforce House in Hull was opened as Britain 's first slavery museum . Wilberforce Memorial School for the Blind in York was established in 1833 in his honour , and in 2006 the University of Hull established the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation in Oriel Chambers , a building adjoining Wilberforce 's birthplace . Various churches within the Anglican Communion commemorate Wilberforce in their liturgical calendars , and Wilberforce University in Ohio , United States , founded in 1856 , is named after him . The university was the first owned by African @-@ American people , and is a historically black college . In Ontario , Canada , Wilberforce Colony was founded by black reformers , and inhabited by free slaves from the United States . Amazing Grace , a film about Wilberforce and the struggle against the slave trade , directed by Michael Apted and starring Ioan Gruffudd and Benedict Cumberbatch was released in 2007 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Parliament 's anti @-@ slave trade legislation ."]}, {"title": ["The New York Times"], "text": ["Still, the makers of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d say their movie raises broader issues.\n\nFor Steven Knight, the film\u2019s British screenwriter, public opinion was for the first time mobilized to press for social reform with the campaign for the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In that sense the use of petitions (including one carrying 390,000 signatures), public meetings, books and pamphlets heralded the birth of modern democratic politics.\n\nMr. Apted saw an opportunity to emphasize the importance of politics, then and now. \u201cI wanted to do a story about the corridors of power,\u201d he said by telephone from Washington, where he was promoting \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d \u201cI am trying to shine a light on the value of politics.\u201d\n\nFor its part Bristol Bay Productions, which financed the $28 million production and favors, in its own words, \u201cuplifting stories,\u201d is looking to communicate a more urgent message. Coinciding with the movie\u2019s release the company, owned by the American billionaire Philip F. Anschutz, has started a campaign called Amazing Change to raise awareness of the continuing existence of slavery around the world.\n\n\u201cAn estimated 27 million people are living in slavery today,\u201d the company said in a press statement explaining Amazing Change. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine, but there are more people living in slavery than at other times in history.\u201d\n\nThe movie\u2019s title is borrowed from the much-loved hymn written by John Newton, himself a former captain of a British slave trader who underwent a religious conversion and who later, as an evangelical minister, became a friend and adviser to Wilberforce.\n\nEarly in the movie the hymn is sung with fervor by Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) in a London club crowded with opponents of his new, and already sputtering, abolitionist campaign. The year is 1787, and the first anti-slave trade bill has just been defeated. A 20-year-long battle begins, and only Wilberforce\u2019s Christian faith will keep him going.\n\nAs it happens, Bristol Bay Productions initially wanted a biopic focused on Wilberforce\u2019s faith, \u201cwhich is why I and a lot of other people didn\u2019t want to make it,\u201d Mr. Apted recalled. \u201cI wanted to center the whole film on the anti-slave trade debate, and they agreed. To me it is about people who have a moral or religious sense of purpose and yet manage to operate in the world.\u201d\n\nMr. Knight (\u201cDirty Pretty Things\u201d), who was brought into the project by Mr. Apted, said he had a special interest in late-18th-century Britain, a time when London was \u201cthe capital of the world\u201d but was also being buffeted by unrest provoked first by the American Revolution, then by the French Revolution.\n\n\u201cYou have to choose your stories,\u201d he added by telephone from Washington. \u201cThis particular story has an in-built Hollywood ending because, after so many years of campaigning, Wilberforce does win, and someone stands up in Parliament to say he is superior to Napoleon because he is peaceful, not warlike.\u201d\n\nInevitably then Wilberforce dominates the movie, but he has many allies, not only the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberbatch), but also fellow members of the so-called Clapham Sect, not least the wild radical Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell). The former slave trader John Newton (Albert Finney) also encourages him, while even the gruff, hard-to-persuade Lord Charles Fox (Michael Gambon) eventually backs him in Parliament.\n\nAt home Wilberforce can also count on the steadfast support of his wife, Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai), who admired his work long before they met and married in 1797.\n\nMuch of the action takes place in country homes, private clubs and the House of Commons. But the reality of the slave trade is represented by Olaudah Equiano (played by the Senegalese singer Youssou N\u2019Dour), a freed slave whose autobiography was a best seller in Britain. In the movie it is thanks to Equiano that Wilberforce has the shocking experience of visiting a slave ship docked in London.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of compression, and we had to take some historical characters out,\u201d Mr. Apted said, \u201cbut it\u2019s pretty much all true, certainly in spirit and essence. His courtship, his relationship with Pitt, Newton\u2019s influence: all true. It had to be very accurate or else it would have lost its power.\u201d\n\nThe movie ends with the anti-slave-trade act of 1807, but the battle against slavery continued. Britain may have had solid economic reasons for using its navy to disrupt French, Spanish and Portuguese slave ships, but it took the next logical step of emancipating the slaves in its Caribbean colonies in August 1833, one month after Wilberforce\u2019s death. It was not until 1888 that Brazil freed its slaves.\n\nIt may seem a bit of a stretch to link \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d to today\u2019s continuing battle against slavery, but the practice still exists in parts of South America, Africa and China, not to mention in some European cities where prostitutes from Africa and Eastern Europe are trapped in forced unpaid labor.\n\nAnd to those who see the Amazing Change campaign by Bristol Bay Productions as just a novel form of movie marketing, Mr. Knight had a sharp response: \u201cI hope that cynics who watch the film will recognize their fellow cynics.\u201d\n\nAn article last Sunday about \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d a film that chronicles activists\u2019 efforts to end British participation in the slave trade in 1807, misidentified the religion of William Wilberforce, one of the activists.

On July 7, 2005, 52 people were killed when four suicide bombers detonated explosive devices on subways and buses. There were commemorations across the nation to honor the victims, including a ceremony of remembrance at the 7/7 memorial in Hyde Park and a service at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\n\nThe 10 years that have elapsed have perhaps softened the original shock, which was not just at the death toll but at the realization that the bombers were not foreigners but British citizens steeped in this country\u2019s life and culture. In the decade since, the homegrown jihadi has become almost a fixture in British life.\n\nThere has been no repeat of the bombings, but the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has transformed the character of domestic jihadism. Some 700 British Muslims are believed to have joined the Islamic State \u2014 not just young men like those who carried out the 7/7 attacks, but mothers, grandfathers, schoolgirls and doctors.\n\nThree days before the anniversary, 12 members of the Mannan family from Luton, a town about 30 miles north of London, put out a statement explaining why they had traveled to Islamic State territory in Syria. The family, of Bangladeshi origin, claimed to be happy to be living in \u201ca land that is free from the corruption and oppression of man-made law and is governed by the Shariah,\u201d referring to Islamic law.\n\nThis exodus to Syria has led non-Muslims to point an accusing finger at Muslim communities. Last month, the prime minister, David Cameron, condemned those who, though not violent, \u201cbuy into\u201d the prejudices of Islamism and \u201cquietly condone\u201d the actions of the Islamic State. A poll published last week found that 56 percent of Britons thought that Islam posed a threat to Western liberal democracy, a figure 10 points higher than a decade ago.\n\nSurveys of Muslim opinion may seem to confirm such perceptions. A poll earlier this year showed that more than a quarter of British Muslims had some sympathy for the motives behind the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed by two gun-wielding Islamists. More than one in 10 thought the magazine deserved to be attacked for lampooning the Prophet Muhammad. A 2006 poll found that 40 percent of Muslims would welcome Shariah law in Britain.\n\nAt the same time, Muslim activists say that anti-Muslim attacks have skyrocketed in recent years. Figures from the Metropolitan Police in 2014 indicated that hate crimes against Muslims had risen by 65 percent in the previous 12 months. Mehdi Hasan, a prominent Muslim commentator, wrote recently of the \u201crelentless hostility towards Muslims.\u201d\n\nAll this might suggest a nation polarized between alienated Muslims and non-Muslims hostile to Islam. The reality is otherwise. What is striking about the past decade is not conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims, but the relative ease with which different communities have got along.\n\nMany polls have shown that Muslims identify with Britain to a greater degree than the population at large. In a 2009 survey, 77 percent said that they strongly identified with Britain, compared with 51 percent of the general population. Similarly, a poll in 2011 found that 83 percent of Muslims were proud to be British, compared with 79 percent of Britons in general.\n\nWhile anti-Muslim hatred is certainly present, there is by no means a climate of \u201crelentless hostility\u201d toward Muslims. According to a poll from the Pew Research Center, 19 percent of Britons had an unfavorable view of Muslims, while 72 percent looked upon Muslims favorably. Nearly twice as many of those surveyed had an unfavorable view of Roma people.\n\nA generation ago, hate crimes like assaults, murders and firebombings were common. Today, vicious racist violence is, thankfully, rare. Much of the rise in hate crimes has involved verbal and online abuse. That is still unacceptable, but we should not exaggerate the hostility.\n\nSo, if in practice Muslims and non-Muslims coexist relatively peaceably, how do we explain the polarization in attitudes? Why do so many non-Muslim Britons regard Islam as a threat, while so many Muslims yearn for Shariah law?\n\nIn part, the seeming contradictions expose the difficulty of reading opinion polls; people\u2019s answers often change significantly, depending on the wording and context of questions. But they also throw light on the character of British society today.\n\nPoliticians constantly call for a defense of British values against extremism. But beyond platitudes about liberal democracy, they find it hard to articulate what those values are. At the same time, these leaders constantly undermine fundamental liberal values in the name of fighting terrorism: They have increased state surveillance, restricted free speech and banned certain organizations.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing disaffection with mainstream politics among Muslims and non-Muslims alike has found expression in a politics of identity, which encourages people to understand their problems through the narrow lenses of culture and faith. The overall result is that people see values less as ideals than in terms of identity. For many non-Muslims, for example, the idea of Shariah conjures images of Islamic State beheadings or the oppression of women. For many Muslims, supporting Shariah may mean no more than an affirmation of identity.\n\nThe real problem is neither Muslim disloyalty nor rampant Islamophobia. It is, rather, the emergence of a tribalized society in which people have an increasingly narrow sense of belonging. At the fringes, this can funnel disaffection into jihadism on one hand, and into anti-Muslim hatred on the other.\n\nBritain is not divided into warring camps, as some would have it. But the consequences of tribalism can be devastating.\n\nKenan Malik, a writer, lecturer and broadcaster, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Quest for a Moral Compass: A Global History of Ethics\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter."], "summary": ["The real threat to social cohesion is not enmity between Muslims and non-Muslims but a regressive politics of identity."]}, {"title": ["Muslims protect Christians from extremists in Kenya bus attack"], "text": ["There was a sound of gunfire, and the impact of bullets striking steel, and the bus suddenly lurched to a stop just outside the northeastern Kenyan city of El Wak.\n\nMore than 10 Somali militants clambered on board, heavily armed, witnesses of the Monday attack told the Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper. The gunmen began shouting demands at the passengers, ordering them to get off the bus and separate into groups \u2014 Muslims on one side, everyone else on the other.\n\nBut Muslims aboard the bus traveling through northeastern Kenya helped protect the Christian passengers, witnesses and officials told numerous media outlets.\n\nTwo people died and at least three were injured during the attack on a bus and a truck, confirmed Mandera County Gov.

A spokesman for the Somalia-based Islamist militant group told Reuters that fighters shot at the bus and \u201csome of the Christian enemies died and others were injured.\u201d\n\nOfficials and witnesses said militants stopped the bus, asked passengers to identify their religion, and then attempted to separate them.\n\nIt\u2019s happened before. In November 2014, al-Shabab gunmen attacked a bus full of teachers in the same region, pulling 28 non-Muslim passengers from the vehicle and shooting them point blank, according to the Guardian. The following month, the BBC reported, the militant group did the same to non-Muslim workers at a quarry near the Somali border. The group has also indiscriminately killed both Muslims and non-Muslims during deadly attacks in Kenya, as with the April siege of Garissa University, in the country\u2019s east, that left 147 dead.\n\nBut not this time. Militants told passengers to get off the bus, \u201cdemanding that Muslims separate from Christians, but they refused,\u201d the Interior Ministry said in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\n\u201cThese Muslims sent a very important message of the unity of purpose, that we are all Kenyans and that we are not separated by religion,\u201d Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery told local media at a briefing. \u201cEverybody can profess their own religion, but we are still one country and one people.\u201d\n\n[Do Muslims and Christians worship the same god?

One person, a non-Muslim decided to run and was shot in the back and died, he said. He said several non-Muslims managed to group with the Muslims.\n\nAn unnamed police official, speaking to AP, and injured witness Abdirashid Adan, speaking with Kenya\u2019s Daily Nation newspaper, said the militants eventually left the bus alone, thinking a police escort was not far behind. The official said a passenger lied about the police escort, while Adan said the sound of the vehicle prompted the gunmen to flee.\n\nWith the militants momentarily gone, the bus quickly departed. But one person died in a subsequent attack on a truck, according to reports.\n\n[What\u2019s behind the return of al-Shabab?]\n\nAfter the bloodshed of the bus attack last November, buses carrying passengers to and from Mandera were given police escorts. But in this case, the bus bypassed a police roadblock, police spokesman Charles Owino told Reuters.\n\nThat 2014 attack also pushed hundreds of non-Muslim civil servants living in Mandera to seek shelter at a Kenyan military base, where they demanded that the government evacuate them from the region, according to the BBC. More than 2,000 teachers and many of the area\u2019s health workers fled, leaving Mandera without many essential services.\n\nKenya\u2019s poorly guarded northeastern border with Somalia is considered a security weak spot for the country. Though al-Shabab is based in Somalia, the group stepped up its cross-border violence after Kenya sent troops into Somalia to help fight the militants in 2011. The group has also said it believes northeastern Kenya should be part of Somalia.\n\nMany Kenyan Muslims of Somali descent live in Mandera, a county on the northeastern border with Somalia.\n\nAttacks by al-Shabab are now a semi-regular horror in Kenya\u2019s eastern regions.\n\nThe incident on the bus Monday was a brave display of solidarity in a country strained by religious conflicts. But it was also a sign of how angry Mandera\u2019s Muslims are about al-Shabab\u2019s relentless violence in their region, the BBC pointed out; they have been victims of extremists\u2019 attacks in the past, though they purportedly were not the targets of attack like the one on Monday.\n\nAs news of Monday\u2019s incident spread on social media, people in Kenya and elsewhere hailed the #ManderaHeroes.\n\nLet my heroism be judged by how I stand with you at your weakest, most vulnerable point.

The ship was owned by the Gregson slave @-@ trading syndicate , based in Liverpool , which participated in the Atlantic slave trade . As was common business practice , they had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves as cargo . When the ship ran low on potable water following navigational mistakes , the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea to drown , partly in order to ensure the survival of the rest of the ship 's inhabitants , and in part to cash in on the insurance on the slaves , thus not losing money on the slaves which would have died from the lack of drinking water . After the slave ship reached port at Black River , Jamaica , the owners of the Zong made a claim to their insurers for the loss of the slaves . When the insurers refused to pay , the resulting court cases ( Gregson v Gilbert ( 1783 ) 3 Doug . KB 232 ) held that in some circumstances , the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves ' deaths . The judge , Lord Chief Justice , the Earl of Mansfield , ruled against the syndicate owners in this case , due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault . Following the first trial , freed slave Olaudah Equiano brought news of the massacre to the attention of the anti @-@ slavery campaigner Granville Sharp , who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship 's crew prosecuted for murder . Because of the legal dispute , reports of the massacre received increased publicity , stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries ; the Zong events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the horrors of the Middle Passage of slaves to the New World . The non @-@ denominational Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded in 1787 . The next year Parliament passed the first law regulating the slave trade , to limit the number of slaves per ship . The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature . It was commemorated in London in 2007 , among events to mark the bicentenary of the British Slave Trade Act 1807 , which abolished the African slave trade . A monument to the killed slaves of the Zong was installed at Black River , Jamaica , their intended port . The Zong was originally named Zorg ( meaning \" Care \" in Dutch ) by its owners , the <unk> <unk> Compagnie . It operated as a slave ship based in Middelburg , Netherlands , and made a voyage in 1777 , delivering slaves to the coast of Suriname , South America . The Zong was a \" square stern ship \" of 110 tons burden . It was captured by a British 16 @-@ gun ship named Alert on 10 February 1781 . By 26 February , the Alert and Zong arrived at Cape Coast Castle , in modern @-@ day Ghana , which was maintained and staffed , along with other forts and castles , by the Royal African Company . The Castle was used as the regional headquarters of the RAC . In early March 1781 , the Zong was purchased by the master of the William , on behalf of a syndicate of Liverpool merchants . The members of the syndicate were Edward Wilson , George Case , James Aspinall and William , James and John Gregson . William Gregson had an interest in 50 slaving voyages between 1747 and 1780 . He served as mayor of Liverpool in 1762 . By the end of his life , vessels in which Gregson had a financial stake had carried 58 @,@ 201 enslaved people from Africa to slavery in the Americas . The Zong was paid for with bills of exchange , and the 244 slaves already on board were part of the transaction . The ship was not insured until after it started its voyage . The insurers , a syndicate from Liverpool , underwrote the ship and slaves for up to \u00a3 8 @,@ 000 , approximately half the slaves ' potential market value . The remaining risk was borne by the owners . The Zong was the first command of Luke Collingwood , formerly the surgeon on the William . While Collingwood lacked experience in navigation and command , ship 's surgeons were typically involved in selecting slaves for purchase in Africa , so their medical expertise supported the determination of \" commodity value \" for a captive . If the surgeon rejected a captive , that individual suffered \" commercial death , \" being of no value and was liable to be killed by African handlers . Sometimes these killings happened in the presence of the surgeon . It is likely that Collingwood had already witnessed the mass @-@ murder of slaves . As the historian Jeremy Krikler commented , this may have prepared him psychologically to condone the massacre which took place on the Zong . The Zong 's first mate was James Kelsall , who had also served on the William . The vessel 's only passenger , Robert Stubbs , was a former captain of slave ships . In early 1780 he was appointed by the African Committee of the Royal African Company , as the governor of Anomabu , a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana . This position made him also vice @-@ president of the RAC Council of the Castle . Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with John Roberts , governor of the Castle , Stubbs was forced out of the governorship of Anomabu by the RAC Council after nine months . Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC , accused him of being a semi @-@ literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave @-@ trading activities of the fort . Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain ; Collingwood may have thought his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful . The Zong had a 17 @-@ man crew when it left Africa , which was far too small to maintain adequate sanitary conditions on the ship . Mariners willing to risk disease and slave rebellions on slave ships were difficult to recruit within Britain and were harder to find for a vessel captured from the Dutch off the coast of Africa . The Zong was manned with remnants of the previous Dutch crew , the crew of the William and with unemployed sailors hired from the settlements along the African coast . The Zong had taken on more than twice the number of people that it could safely transport , when it sailed from Accra with 442 enslaved people on 18 August 1781 . In the 1780s , British @-@ built ships typically carried 1 @.@ 75 enslaved people per ton of the ship 's capacity ; on the Zong , the ratio was 4 @.@ 0 per ton . A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193 enslaved and it was extremely unusual for a ship of the Zong 's relatively small size to carry so many . After taking on drinking water at S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 , the Zong began its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to Jamaica on 6 September . On 18 or 19 November , the ship neared Tobago in the Caribbean but failed to stop there to replenish its water supplies . It is unclear who , if anyone , was in charge of the ship at this point . The captain Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time . The man who would normally have replaced him , first mate James Kelsall , had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14 November . Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded the Zong in Collingwood 's absence but he was not a registered member of the vessel 's crew . According to historian James Walvin , the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain why subsequent navigational errors were committed and why checks on supplies of drinking water were not made . On 27 or 28 November , the crew sighted Jamaica at a distance of 27 nautical miles ( 50 km ; 31 mi ) but misidentified it as the French colony of Saint @-@ Domingue on the island of Hispaniola . The Zong continued on its westward course , leaving Jamaica behind . This mistake was recognised only after the ship was 300 miles ( 480 km ) leeward of the island . Overcrowding , malnutrition , accidents and disease had already killed several mariners and approximately 62 enslaved Africans . James Kelsall later claimed that there was only four days ' water remaining on the ship , when the navigational error was discovered and Jamaica was still 10 \u2013 13 sailing days away . If the enslaved died onshore , the Liverpool ship @-@ owners would have had no redress from their insurers . Similarly , if the slaves died a \" natural death \" ( as the contemporary term put it ) at sea , then insurance could not be claimed . If some slaves were jettisoned in order to save the rest of the \" cargo \" or the ship , then a claim could be made under the notion of \" general average \" . The ship 's insurance covered the loss of slaves at \u00a3 30 a head . On 29 November , the crew assembled to consider the proposal that some of the slaves should be thrown overboard . James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed . On 29 November , 54 women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea . On 1 December , 42 male slaves were thrown overboard ; 36 slaves followed in the next few days . Another ten , in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers , jumped into the sea . Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water , one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea . This request was ignored by the crew . The account of the King 's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship . The crew claimed that the slaves had been jettisoned because the ship did not have enough water to keep all the slaves alive for the rest of the voyage . This claim was later disputed , as the ship had 420 imperial gallons ( 1 @,@ 900 l ) of water left when it arrived in Jamaica on 22 December . An affidavit later made by Kelsall , stated that on 1 December , when 42 slaves were killed , it rained heavily for more than a day , allowing six casks of water ( sufficient for eleven days ) to be collected . On 22 December 1781 , the Zong arrived at Black River , Jamaica , with 208 enslaved people on board , less than half the number taken from Africa . The enslaved people sold for an average price of \u00a3 36 each . The Jamaican Vice @-@ Admiralty court upheld the legality of the British capture of the Zong from the Dutch , and the syndicate renamed the ship Richard of Jamaica . Luke Collingwood died three days after the Zong reached Jamaica , two years before the 1783 court proceedings about the case . When the news of the Zong 's voyage reached Britain , the ship 's owners claimed compensation from their insurers for the loss of the slaves . The insurers refused to honour the claim and were taken to court by the Liverpool syndicate . The logbook of the Zong went missing after the ship reached Jamaica , two years before the hearings started . The legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre but there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the appeals hearing . The ship 's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed , which the Gregson syndicate denied . Almost all the surviving source material is of questionable reliability . The two witnesses who gave evidence , Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall , were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame . It is possible that the figures concerning the number of slaves killed , the amount of water that remained on the ship and the distance beyond Jamaica that the Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate . Legal proceedings began when the insurers refused to compensate the owners of the Zong . The dispute was initially tried at the Guildhall in London on 6 March 1783 , with the Lord Chief Justice , the Earl of Mansfield , overseeing the trial before a jury . Mansfield was previously the judge in Somersett 's Case in 1772 , which concerned the legality of keeping slaves in Britain . He had ruled that slavery had never been established by statute in Britain and was not supported by common law . Robert Stubbs was the only witness in the first Zong trial and the jury found in favour of the owners , under an established protocol in maritime insurance that considered slaves as cargo . On 19 March 1783 , Olaudah Equiano , a freed slave , told the anti @-@ slave @-@ trade activist Granville Sharp of the events aboard the Zong and a newspaper soon carried a lengthy account , reporting that the captain had ordered the slaves killed in three batches . Sharp sought legal advice the next day , about the possibility of prosecuting the crew for murder . The insurers of the Zong applied to the Earl of Mansfield to have the previous verdict set aside and for the case to be tried again . A hearing was held at the Court of King 's Bench in Westminster Hall from 21 \u2013 22 May 1783 , before Mansfield and two other King 's Bench judges , Mr Justice Buller and Mr Justice Willes . The Solicitor General , John Lee , appeared on behalf of the Zong 's owners , as he had done previously in the Guildhall trial . Granville Sharp was also in attendance , together with a secretary he had hired to take a written record of the proceedings . Summing up the verdict reached in the first trial , Mansfield said that the jury , had no doubt ( though it shocks one very much ) that the Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses had been thrown over board ... The Question was , whether there was not an Absolute Necessity for throwing them over board to save the rest , [ and ] the Jury were of opinion there was ... Collingwood had died in 1781 soon after the ship reached Jamaica and the only witness of the Zong massacre to appear at Westminster Hall was passenger Robert Stubbs , although a written affidavit by first mate James Kelsall was made available to the lawyers . Stubbs claimed that there was \" an absolute Necessity for throwing over the Negroes \" , because the crew feared all the slaves would die if they did not throw some into the sea . The insurers of the Zong argued that Collingwood had made \" a Blunder and Mistake \" in sailing beyond Jamaica and that the slaves had been killed so their owners could claim compensation . They alleged that Collingwood did this , because he did not want his first voyage as a slave ship captain to be unprofitable . John Lee responded by saying that the slaves \" perished just as a Cargo of Goods perished \" and were jettisoned for the greater good of the ship . The insurers ' legal team replied that Lee 's argument could never justify the killing of innocent people ; each of the three addressed issues of humanity in the treatment of the slaves and said that the actions of the Zong 's crew were nothing less than murder . As historian James Walvin has argued , it is possible that Granville Sharp directly influenced the strategy of the insurers ' legal team . At the hearing , new evidence was heard , that heavy rain had fallen on the ship on the second day of the killings but a third batch of slaves was killed after that . This led Mansfield to order another trial , because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves , after the water shortage had been eased , could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo . One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial , as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship , brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions , rather than from errors committed by its captain . Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by the Zong 's crew . There is no evidence that another trial was held on this issue . Despite Granville Sharp 's efforts , no member of the crew was prosecuted for the murder of the slaves . A summary of the appeal on the Zong case , was eventually published in the nominate reports prepared from the contemporaneous manuscript notes of Sylvester Douglas , Baron Glenbervie , and others . It was published in 1831 as Gregson v Gilbert ( 1783 ) 3 Doug . KB 232 . Jeremy Krikler has argued that Mansfield wanted to ensure that commercial law remained as helpful to Britain 's overseas trade as possible and as a consequence was keen to uphold the principle of \" general average \" , even in relation to the killing of humans . This principle holds that a captain who jettisons part of his cargo in order to save the rest can claim for the loss from his insurers . For Mansfield to have found in favour of the insurers would have greatly undermined this idea . The revelation that rain had fallen during the period of the killings enabled Mansfield to order a retrial , while leaving the notion of \" general average \" intact . He emphasised that the massacre would have been legally justified and the owners ' insurance claim would have been valid , if the water shortage had not arisen from mistakes made by the captain . Krikler comments that Mansfield 's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor , Matthew Hale , that the killing of innocents in the name of self @-@ preservation was unlawful . This ruling was to prove important a century later in R v Dudley and Stephens , which also concerned the <unk> of acts of murder at sea . Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle \u2014 that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act . Granville Sharp campaigned to raise awareness of the massacre , writing letters to newspapers , the Lords Commissioners of Admiralty and the Prime Minister ( the Duke of Portland ) . Neither Portland nor the Admiralty sent him a reply . The first Zong trial in March 1783 , had been reported only by a single London newspaper but it provided details of events . Little about the massacre appeared in print before 1787 . The newspaper article in March 1783 was the first public report of the massacre , and it was published nearly 18 months after the event . Despite these setbacks , Sharp 's efforts did have some success . In April 1783 , he sent an account of the Zong massacre to William Dillwyn , a Quaker , who had asked to see evidence that was critical of the slave trade . The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery , and a petition signed by 273 Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783 . Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause . The immediate effect of the Zong massacre on public opinion was limited , demonstrating \u2014 as the historian of abolitionism Seymour Drescher has noted \u2014 the challenge that the early abolitionists faced . Following Sharp 's efforts , the Zong massacre became an important topic in abolitionist literature and the massacre was discussed in works by Thomas Clarkson , <unk> <unk> , James Ramsay and John Newton . These accounts often omitted the names of the ship and its captain , thereby creating , in the words of <unk> Swaminathan , \" a portrait of abuse that could be mapped onto any ship in the Middle Passage \" . The Zong killings offered a powerful example of the horrors of the slave trade , stimulating the development of the abolitionist movement in Britain , which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s . In 1787 , the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded . Parliament received numerous petitions against the slave trade and examined the issue in 1788 . With strong support by Sir William Dolben , who had toured a slave ship , it passed the Slave Trade Act 1788 ( Dolben 's Act ) , which was its first legislation to regulate the slave trade . It restricted the number of slaves that could be transported , to reduce problems of overcrowding and poor sanitation . Its renewal in 1794 included an amendment that limited the scope of insurance policies concerning slaves , rendering illegal such generalised phrases that promised to insure against \" all other Perils , Losses , and Misfortunes . \" ( The Zong owners ' representatives had highlighted such a phrase in seeking their claim at the King 's Bench hearing . ) The act had to be renewed annually and Dolben led these efforts , speaking frequently to parliament in opposition to slavery . The Slave Trade Act of 1799 was passed to make these provisions permanent . <unk> , notably William Wilberforce , continued their effort to end the slave trade . Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807 , which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade , and the Royal Navy enforced the Blockade of Africa . The United States also prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea , predominately after 1842 . In 1823 , the Anti @-@ Slavery Society was founded in Britain , dedicated to abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire , later achieved through the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . The massacre on the Zong was frequently cited in abolitionist literature in the 19th century ; in 1839 , Thomas Clarkson published his History of the Rise , Progress , and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade , which included an account of the Zong killings . Clarkson 's book had an important influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner , who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship . The painting depicts a vessel , from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea , to be devoured by sharks . Some of the details in the painting , such as the shackles worn by the slaves , appear to have been influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson 's book . The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide , as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti @-@ Slavery Convention in London . The painting was admired by its owner , John Ruskin . It has been described by the 20th @-@ century critic Marcus Wood as one of the few truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade . The Zong has inspired several works of literature . Fred D <unk> 's novel Feeding the Ghosts ( 1997 ) tells the story of an enslaved African who survives being thrown overboard from the Zong . In the novel , the journal of the slave \u2014 <unk> \u2014 is lost , unlike that of Granville Sharp . According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht , this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre . M. <unk> Philip 's 2008 poetry book , Zong ! is based on the events surrounding the massacre and uses the account of the King 's Bench hearing as its source . Margaret Busby 's play An African Cargo , staged by Nitro theatre company at Greenwich Theatre in 2007 , dealt with the massacre and the 1783 trials , making use of the legal transcripts . An episode of the television programme Garrow 's Law ( 2010 ) is loosely based on the legal events arising from the massacre . The historical William Garrow did not take part in the case , and because the Zong 's captain died shortly after arriving in Jamaica , his appearance in court for fraud is also fictional . In 2007 , a memorial stone was erected at Black River , Jamaica , near where the Zong would have landed . A sailing ship representing Zong was sailed to Tower Bridge in London in March 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act , at a cost of \u00a3 300 @,@ 000 . The vessel housed depictions of the Zong massacre and the slave trade . It was accompanied by HMS Northumberland , with an exhibition on board commemorating the role of the Royal Navy in the suppression of the slave trade after 1807 ."]}, {"title": ["Anger over EU's 'slave trade' rhetoric as naval operations begin in Mediterranean"], "text": ["More than 300 leading migration experts have collectively denounced plans for military operations against Libyan smugglers, calling them \u201centirely self-serving\u201d, based on \u201ca dangerous perversion of history\u201d, and reminiscent of the actions of countries that enabled the 18th-century slavery business.\n\nThe academics\u2019 provocative intervention follows the EU\u2019s decision on Monday to begin naval operations that will target the complex web of Libyan smugglers who ferry hundreds of thousands of migrants towards Europe every year. In the runup to the decision, some EU politicians equated the planned mission with attempts to end the slave trade in the 18th century. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, described people-smugglers as \u201cthe slave traders of the 21st century\u201d who \u201cshould be brought to justice\u201d.\n\nBut 300 migration experts from universities including Oxford, Harvard, the London School of Economics, the School of Oriental and African Studies, Yale and Princeton have turned Renzi\u2019s argument on its head, arguing that it is in fact the actions of the EU that most recall the mindset of 18th-century slave states. They claim that by attempting to destroy smuggling networks without providing alternative safe routes out of north Africa, Europe seeks to restrict the movement of Africans with actions that evoke those of slave traders in centuries past.\n\nWriting on the website OpenDemocracy, the 300 say: \u201cTo attempt to crush [people-smuggling] with military force is not to take a noble stand against the evil of slavery, or even against \u2018trafficking\u2019. It is simply to continue a long tradition in which states, including slave states of the 18th and 19th century, use violence to prevent certain groups of human beings from moving freely.\u201d\n\nThey argue that virtuous talk of ending a 21st-century slave trade is both an \u201centirely self-serving\u201d attempt to mask Europe\u2019s unwillingness to provide safe access to European shores, and a \u201cpatently false\u201d interpretation of the history of the slave trade.\n\nThe article states: \u201cAs scholarship on the history of slavery makes painfully clear, what is happening in the Mediterranean today does not even remotely resemble the transatlantic slave trade. Enslaved Africans did not want to move \u2026 Today, those embarking on the journey to Europe want to move. If they were free to do so, they would be taking advantage of the flights that budget airlines operate between North Africa and Europe at a tiny fraction of the cost of the extraordinarily dangerous sea passage. And it is not \u2018slavers\u2019 or \u2018traffickers\u2019 who are preventing them from accessing this safe route.\u201d\n\nRelated: Italian coastguards: military action will not solve Mediterranean migrant crisis\n\nThe academics join a growing list of critics who have spoken out against military action. Separately, the Italian coastguards who coordinate Europe\u2019s emergency search-and-rescue operations in the southern Mediterranean told the Guardian on Monday that the smuggling crackdown would not end such a huge wave of migration. Both of Libya\u2019s rival governments have said EU incursions into Libyan waters would be an infringement of Libyan sovereignty.\n\nOn-the-ground reporting of Libyan smuggling networks suggests that pre-emptive military action would also struggle for practical reasons. According to smugglers and fishermen, smuggling vessels are often simply fishing boats bought on a one-time-use basis in the days prior to a smuggling mission, and kept in civilian harbours until the evening of their departure.\n\nTo those not involved in the transaction, the boat\u2019s new purpose would only be hinted at once it left port in the early evening, and dropped anchor some distance from the shore to await the arrival of its passengers by dinghy. This gives European navies only a brief window to identify smuggling vessels, and to destroy them without endangering innocent life."], "summary": ["Migration experts condemn \u2018entirely self-serving\u2019 language concealing the fact that refugees are trying to escape Africa of their own free will"]}, {"title": ["Op-Ed Contributor - How to End the Slavery Blame-Game - NYTimes.com"], "text": ["THANKS to an unlikely confluence of history and genetics \u0097 the fact that he is African-American and president \u0097 Barack Obama has a unique opportunity to reshape the debate over one of the most contentious issues of America\u2019s racial legacy: reparations, the idea that the descendants of American slaves should receive compensation for their ancestors\u2019 unpaid labor and bondage.\n\nThere are many thorny issues to resolve before we can arrive at a judicious (if symbolic) gesture to match such a sustained, heinous crime. Perhaps the most vexing is how to parcel out blame to those directly involved in the capture and sale of human beings for immense economic gain.\n\nWhile we are all familiar with the role played by the United States and the European colonial powers like Britain, France, Holland, Portugal and Spain, there is very little discussion of the role Africans themselves played. And that role, it turns out, was a considerable one, especially for the slave-trading kingdoms of western and central Africa. These included the Akan of the kingdom of Asante in what is now Ghana, the Fon of Dahomey (now Benin), the Mbundu of Ndongo in modern Angola and the Kongo of today\u2019s Congo, among several others.\n\nFor centuries, Europeans in Africa kept close to their military and trading posts on the coast. Exploration of the interior, home to the bulk of Africans sold into bondage at the height of the slave trade, came only during the colonial conquests, which is why Henry Morton Stanley\u2019s pursuit of Dr. David Livingstone in 1871 made for such compelling press: he was going where no (white) man had gone before.\n\nHow did slaves make it to these coastal forts? The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders. The sad truth is that without complex business partnerships between African elites and European traders and commercial agents, the slave trade to the New World would have been impossible, at least on the scale it occurred.\n\nAdvocates of reparations for the descendants of those slaves generally ignore this untidy problem of the significant role that Africans played in the trade, choosing to believe the romanticized version that our ancestors were all kidnapped unawares by evil white men, like Kunta Kinte was in \u201cRoots.\u201d The truth, however, is much more complex: slavery was a business, highly organized and lucrative for European buyers and African sellers alike.\n\nThe African role in the slave trade was fully understood and openly acknowledged by many African-Americans even before the Civil War. For Frederick Douglass, it was an argument against repatriation schemes for the freed slaves. \u201cThe savage chiefs of the western coasts of Africa, who for ages have been accustomed to selling their captives into bondage and pocketing the ready cash for them, will not more readily accept our moral and economical ideas than the slave traders of Maryland and Virginia,\u201d he warned. \u201cWe are, therefore, less inclined to go to Africa to work against the slave trade than to stay here to work against it.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the African role in the slave trade was greatly reduced after 1807, when abolitionists, first in Britain and then, a year later, in the United States, succeeded in banning the importation of slaves. Meanwhile, slaves continued to be bought and sold within the United States, and slavery as an institution would not be abolished until 1865. But the culpability of American plantation owners neither erases nor supplants that of the African slavers. In recent years, some African leaders have become more comfortable discussing this complicated past than African-Americans tend to be.\n\nIn 1999, for instance, President Mathieu Kerekou of Benin astonished an all-black congregation in Baltimore by falling to his knees and begging African-Americans\u2019 forgiveness for the \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cabominable\u201d role Africans played in the trade. Other African leaders, including Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, followed Mr. Kerekou\u2019s bold example.\n\nOur new understanding of the scope of African involvement in the slave trade is not historical guesswork. Thanks to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, directed by the historian David Eltis of Emory University, we now know the ports from which more than 450,000 of our African ancestors were shipped out to what is now the United States (the database has records of 12.5 million people shipped to all parts of the New World from 1514 to 1866). About 16 percent of United States slaves came from eastern Nigeria, while 24 percent came from the Congo and Angola.\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr., a professor at Harvard, is the author of the forthcoming \u0093Faces of America\u0094 and \u0093Tradition and the Black Atlantic.\u0094"], "summary": ["The debate over slavery reparations ignores Africans\u2019 role in selling human beings."]}, {"title": ["A Lesson for Understanding Islam in America"], "text": ["At no point in American history has it been more critical to have a dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims. And at no point of the year is better to make that happen than this month of Ramadan.\n\nWith some politicians using American Muslims as a political football, the levels of anti-Muslim crimes have dramatically increased. As I write in my new book, Talk To Me: Changing the Narrative on Race, Religion, and Education:\n\nWe cannot live our lives in fear and ignorance of the other, of what we do not understand. \u2026 We must cut through the rust that prevents us from recognizing one another, champion a jihad that involves communicating with people of different races and faiths \u2026 and do so with a progressive and educated narrative.\n\nFear is a powerful motivator, and American Muslims have the lowest approval rating of any religious demographic in America. That fear isn\u2019t based in education; it\u2019s based in ignorance. Too few Americans have ever met a Muslim, and therefore too few can differentiate between true Islam and what extremists teach.\n\nThe good news is not only that we can remedy this education gap, but also that history is on our side. Throughout history, Islam and Muslims have played a pivotal role in America\u2019s progress. Prior to America\u2019s founding, African Muslims represented up to 15% of those enslaved in the \u201cnew world.\u201d Muslims literally helped build this country under forced slave labor\u2014our blood sweat and tears are just as important a contribution as anyone\u2019s. Moreover, when the U.S. declared independence from Britain, none other than the Muslim majority nation of Morocco was the first country to recognize America\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nMorocco\u2019s conscious choice to recognize America\u2014certainly to Britain\u2019s objection\u2014was perhaps a reminder of a remarkable event during Prophet Muhammad\u2019s lifetime. After suffering brutal persecution under Mecca\u2019s oppressive government, Muhammad ordered his companions to either bear the persecution peacefully or migrate from their ancestral homes. Several migrated and under Muhammad\u2019s direction, sought refuge under the righteous Christian King of Abyssinia, which the King granted. This Muslim-Christian alliance\u2014certainly to the Meccan government\u2019s objection\u2014lasted centuries, fostering peace, education and progress.\n\nMuslim Americans have defended the U.S. in every war this nation has ever fought, and to this day thousands serve in each branch of the armed forces. Nearly one in 10 American physicians are Muslim\u2014a reflection of Islam\u2019s fundamental obligation on Muslims to serve all humanity. As America is a racially diverse nation, the American Muslim community represents among the country\u2019s most racially diverse demographics.\n\nBut you wouldn\u2019t know any of this from listening to some politicians. America is at a crossroads, and it is critical we walk down the same road together.\n\nThere are more than 3 million American Muslims, each with an exciting history, dynamic family and aspirational future. This Ramadan, go meet them. Attend a mosque\u2019s iftar dinner (breaking of the fast) or perhaps even fast with an American Muslim friend. If you don\u2019t know any American Muslims\u2014you do now by reading this. Come talk to me.\n\nRamadan comes from a root word that means to \u201cheat intensely,\u201d or \u201cto burn.\u201d During Ramadan, Muslims fast to wage an internal Jihad, an internal struggle to burn away the impurities that afflict their bodies, minds and souls. It is a month to mend hearts, mend souls and mend relationships both with God and with fellow human beings.\n\nWe need not look at history alone to appreciate the connectedness of Islam and America. As we mourn the passing of the great Muhammad Ali, we see a man who never compromised his faith as a Muslim, his identity as a black man, or his nationality as an American. Ali did all this because he was an American and because he was a Muslim. As His Holiness the Khalifa of Islam recently advised: \u201ctrue integration is to love the country in which you live and to be completely loyal to it.\u201d\n\nRamadan is our opportunity as Muslims and non-Muslims to truly integrate with one another. It is our opportunity to burn away the rust, fear and ignorance which currently risks an uncertain future, and replace it with trust, compassion and education. The road here has not been easy, but that is why it is worthwhile. Use this Ramadan to stay on the road more travelled\u2014a peaceful and educated unity between Muslims and non-Muslims.\n\nThis act will ensure a continued progressive struggle that has already spanned hundreds of years."], "summary": ["There's a big difference between true Islam and what extremists teach"]}, {"title": ["One faith, but many viewpoints"], "text": ["For the last month, Americans have received a crash course in Islam that divides Muslims into two camps: terrorists who hate the West, and Muslims who support the United States unconditionally and reject Islamic movements.\n\nBut Muslims in Chicago and nationwide can no more be divided into simple categories than Christians or Jews.\n\nThough most condemn Osama bin Laden's terrorism, Muslims hold differing views on U.S. foreign policy, on when and if armed conflict is morally justified, and on whether they support Islamic political movements and states.\n\nPalestinians Ohood and Marwan Murrar of Burbank, the parents of a week-old boy, dream of the day Muslims throughout the world can live in peace in Islamic states governed by Islamic principles. \"Everybody likes his religion to be No. 1,\" said Marwan Murrar, a 29-year-old pizzamaker.\n\nMoin Khan of Lombard believes that Islamic values, such as freedom of religion, are most present in this country, and he tries to convince his Muslim friends of the need for the separation of religion and state.\n\nHabeeba Moiduddin, 44, a physician from Burr Ridge, was deeply distraught when Osama bin Laden made a statement referring to the suffering of Iraqis and Palestinians. \"There's no way you can justify killing innocent people based on what's happening in Palestine,\" she said.\n\nBut Frederick Thaufeer al-Deen, a Chicago-based imam, said what bin Laden is saying matters. \"It was the first time I saw mention of the death and carnage our policy is having in the Muslim world,\" he said.\n\nFor non-Muslims to have more than a superficial understanding of their neighbors, scholars say, requires letting go of stereotypical notions and inquiring about the deeper political and religious concerns that guide Muslims' lives.\n\n\"We have to develop a nuanced appreciation of Islam,\" said John Esposito, director of Georgetown University's Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. \"Militant Islam versus pacifist Islam is an exaggerated notion. Once we get a sense of the diversity, there'll be less of a tendency to bounce from poles of demonization to the complete opposite.\"\n\nM. Cherif Bassiouni, a DePaul University law professor specializing in human rights, says that to begin to comprehend Muslims' differing political concerns, one has only to remember that the United States is home to Muslims from more than 60 countries as well as a large African-American Muslim community.\n\nIraqi-American Muslims may be focused on protesting sanctions, and Indians may be concerned about fighting in Kashmir, while Palestinians are determined to get a homeland.\n\nOne Muslim may be a pacifist. The other may support armed conflict even while rejecting bin Laden's brand of militant Islam.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Marwan Murrar sat on his living room couch beneath a large picture of the golden Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem while scenes of Palestinians flashed on an Arabic-language television station.\n\n\"I just want peace everywhere,\" said Ohood Murrar, 23, holding her newborn son. \"A lot of Muslims want peace with Americans, with Jews, with everyone.\" She and her husband said they lament the terrorist acts that took Christian, Muslim and Jewish lives.\n\nStill, the Murrars object vehemently to U.S. support for Israel and insist that Palestinians have the moral right to respond in self-defense. They back Hamas and disagree with those who call it a terrorist group.\n\n\"Israel kills our people and kills our babies, and Hamas fights back,\" he said. \"These groups fight for their country.\"\n\nScott Alexander, a professor of Islamic studies at the Catholic Theological Union, said in the current climate many Americans want all Muslims to prove they are peace-loving by disavowing all Islamic movements that engage in violence.\n\n\"But they're not going to do that,\" he said. \"in cases they feel they're fighting for a just cause.\"\n\nTen miles away in Burr Ridge, another Muslim couple, originally from India, rejects the use of violence except in the most dire cases of self-defense.\n\n\"We should condemn violence in every part of the world,\" says Shakir Moiduddin, 54, Habeeba's husband and a father of five.\n\nHis family's first concern, he said, is the healing of the country they consider their first home: the United States.\n\n\"We don't have any ties to any other countries,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to foreign policy, they care about any nations that have been denied the right to self-determination, not just Muslim countries.\n\n\"When anybody has their rights trampled, we feel the same compassion, whether they are Muslim, Christian or Jew,\" Habeeba Moiduddin said.\n\nStill, as U.S. citizens who would not live anywhere else, the Moiduddins say they have a right to point to where they think the United States is falling short without having their loyalty called into question.\n\nBut many Muslims are offering critiques of U.S. policy that others consider harsh or unwise, such as denouncing the sanctions against Iraq or objecting to troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.\n\nEven bin Laden's analysis of U.S. policy rings true to some Muslims, even as they reject his use of terror.\n\nSuch thoughts trouble Muslims like the Moiduddins, who think the mere existence of bin Laden gives Muslims a bad name.\n\n\"But I think a large number of Muslims like bin Laden's message,\" said Bassiouni. \"Non-Muslims can't understand because they can't have the same emotional reaction as people who have lived in poverty and ignorance for generations and simply don't see a way out.\n\n\"When he says there are corrupt governments in the Muslim world, everyone agrees. When he says America supports those governments and shares in the responsibility, everyone agrees. When he says that Israel did terrible things to the Palestinian people ... everyone agrees.

His oration is often considered a radical denunciation of America's political tradition; he characterized the Fourth of July as a hypocritical sham from the point of view of the millions living in the country who were still enslaved.\n\nThe speech, which is now widely titled \"What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?,\" has become a staple of high-school and college education. In my class at Christopher Newport University, students read Douglass's speech alongside other famous texts on slavery, abolition and free labor. Of these, Lincoln and Douglass are arguably the most readable and popular.\n\nDouglass in particular makes his points in a way that is simultaneously generous, mean, cruel, funny and memorable. Like a good tweet. Perhaps for this reason, social media have recently picked up on Douglass's writings. And students can now choose from a growing variety of online deliveries by James Earl Jones, Morgan Freeman, Danny Glover and stage actors. But as with all great works, popularization has its hazards.\n\nDouglass's masterpiece is more than 10,000 words long\u2014shorter than the average sermon but longer than the average 50-minute college lecture. So the speech is often abridged. Not surprisingly, videos tend to highlight the more combustible paragraphs, especially those sections that contain Douglass's apocalyptic phraseology. \"It is not light that is needed, but fire,\" he says. We \"need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.\" Freedom requires \"scorching irony,\" biting ridicule, blasting reproach.\n\nFourth of July celebrations are merely a thin veil \"to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\" The shouts of liberty and equality were \"hollow mockery.\" The parades, the hymns, the rituals \"mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy.\" What, to the slave, is the Fourth of July? \"A day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.\"\n\nYet abridging his speech risks distorting Douglass's intentions, cheapening his legacy, and robbing his great oration of its educational value.\n\nDespite his fiery rhetoric, Douglass was neither despairing nor unduly cynical about his country. The opening and conclusion of the speech are hopeful, if not optimistic. The nation is young. America, he says, is at an \"impressible\" stage of her existence, like a child. Douglass claimed to be a man of \"little learning,\" but he was a careful thinker. He did not lionize the revolutionary generation in the clich\u00e9d terms thrown around by many Independence Day celebrants\u2014but he stood by the Founders \"for the good they did, and the principles they contended for.\"\n\nTheir achievement, he said, was to raise national independence above private interests; they stood for peace, although they preferred revolution to peaceful bondage; for tranquility, although they did not shrink from agitating against oppression; for forbearance, within limits; and for order, but not the order of tyranny. Yes, they did not solve the problem of slavery, but Douglass nevertheless asserts that their \"final\" cause was justice, liberty and humanity. Their leadership \"stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.\"\n\nIn its full context, Douglass's oration was not intended to make Americans despise their country or its origins. His targets were the \"flesh-jobbers\" driving the internal American slave trade; the disgraceful judges and lawmakers who support the Fugitive Slave Law; and the \"wickedly indifferent\" ministers and churches who had become the \"bulwark of American slavery\" and a shield for American slave-hunters.\n\nHe also makes a firm if subtle defense of the Constitution. At the time there were critics and defenders of slavery who interpreted the nation's foundational law as a pro-slavery instrument. Douglass viewed this as indefensible slander. He denies the existence of a single pro-slavery clause in it, arguing instead that the Constitution was \"entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.\"\n\nDouglass was not always so confident about this claim. Three years earlier, in 1849, he analyzed the Constitution's slave-holding compromises\u2014on the \"infernal\" slave trade, on fugitive slaves\u2014in the pages of his own newspaper, the North Star. But his reasoned opinion in the Fourth of July oration was that the Constitution was constructed to aid in the downfall of slavery. It was not pro-slavery, but rather a \"glorious liberty document.\"\n\nDouglass urged readers to be attentive to the Constitution as a whole, including the preamble, which he viewed as the \"gateway\" to its meaning. And crucially, he reminded them of the intimate connection between the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, which affirmed the truth of liberty and equality. He considered the Declaration \"the first great fact in [the] nation's history\" and \"the very ring-bolt in the chain of [the nation's] undeveloped destiny.\"\n\nDouglass admits that his speech paints a dark picture of the country. He spoke ominously of clouds \"which lower above the horizon.\" Yet students and modern Americans who hear or read only these sections of the speech miss out on the reasons for optimism. The famous 1852 address should not be misconstrued as a rejection of America's political tradition. Douglass's speech in Rochester was a tribute to national independence, to political freedom, and to the coming into being of a nation.\n\nMr. Bibby, a visiting professor of American studies at Christopher Newport University, is completing a book on \"Montesquieu's Political Economy\" (under contract, Palgrave Macmillan)."], "summary": ["In The Wall Street Journal, Andrew Bibby writes that Frederick Douglass's fiery Independence Day speech is widely read today, but  not so widely understood."]}, {"title": ["Why 12 Years a Slave should win best picture at the 2014 Oscars - video"], "text": ["Each day until the Academy Awards ceremony on 2 March our critics will make the case for an Oscar contender.

These voices, presumably, are silent and perpetuate fears that Muslims are violent and oppress women.\n\nWhile Ms Griswold's intent is laudable--give Muslims a platform to share their own views--a Million Muslim March would amount to yet another hoop that Muslims must jump through to prove their fidelity to this nation. Over the last several years television talking heads chastised Muslim Americans for being silent against terrorism (despite ample evidence to the contrary). Subsequently, Muslim organizations became \"condemnation mills\" churning out statements almost weekly to show their displeasure of violent extremism.\n\nThe results have been lackluster in both improving the public opinion of Muslim Americans and in preventing Muslim Americans from engaging in real or alleged violent tendencies (see Major Nidal Hassan, Fort Dix plotters, Al Shabab wannabes, \"Virginia Five\").\n\nPolitical commentators assert that Muslims have not been vocal and visible enough to show their love of American ideals and disgust for violence in the name of their religion. But will a National Mall rally with Muslim women in star-spangled hijabs and toddlers hoisting placards with patriotic themes do the trick?\n\nI am not convinced that such a show of fervor will have much of an effect on changing public perception. Those favoring Muslims will continue to do so. The segment that believes that Muslims need to be saved from Islam will see the rally as a demonstration of the arcane practice of taqiyya.\n\nOthers will find the march as another example of the scary Islamization of America. In the end, the cash and effort of staging such an event will only be seen as a publicity stunt--hollow, or worse, disingenuous.\n\nIf statements of condemnation are cheap and rallies are photo ops, then what can be done to convince Americans to like Muslims? There is no easy solution. Trust takes time. It takes conversations that lead to friendships. This can take years if not generations. It takes courage to start the dialogue. It takes strength for politicians to visit mosques, especially outside of election season. It takes character to be sensitive and to reach out to those who lost loved ones due to terrorists' attacks.\n\nRallies are easily caricaturized and public service announcements are often lifeless.

Why do the muslims take it upon themselves to protest Israel in far away places as Malaysia, Indonesia, US, Canada, etc, etc. It is in Israel, let them protest there. If muslims maintain that in every part of the world no body would have any problem. This is the double standard, everyone complains. What do you have to say? It is this kind of double standard that makes the rest of the world has problem with. You demand every possible rights that is available and use every available recourse legal or otherwise.
