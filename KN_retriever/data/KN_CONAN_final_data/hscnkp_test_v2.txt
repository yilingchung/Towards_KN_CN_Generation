Four of the offenders were white and three were black, the FBI report said. Some of them deliberately operate within residential areas and between civilians, this makes civilians more vulnerable. Jeffrey Tawse, 52, and his son James, 25, were found guilty of targeting vulnerable people in the community, with the cowboy builders performing a string of truly appalling rip off garden jobs.

But he must examine his conscience: How is it consistent with religious faith to stir hatred and killing? While the Nation shares some practices of mainstream Islam, the movement, which started in 1930s Detroit, deviates from the orthodox faith in significant ways, including on race. Anders Behring Breivik, the confessed bomber and shooter in this horrendous act, was not motivated by the teachings of Islam, but by the teachings of those who oppose Islam. But I can still raise my voice against words of hatred. <CN> 
<HS> Islam is not a faith, it is a motivation for stupid sexual disturbed persons and for criminals who contaminate the world. <knowl> Nor will I tell you that Islam is a religion of violence. Without hard evidence, critics say, ascribing a religious motivation to crimes committed by Muslims demeans Islam. We know of -- are -- the bombers were motivated by religion.

There is no question the Obama administration's greatest failure is allowing the Islamic terror group ISIS to run wild, murdering thousands of innocent people all over the world, including many Muslims, said O'Reilly.

It is still plausible, however, that the limited support for extremism which does exist is partially driven by state-sponsored violence. Rather, it is also due largely to Islam itself and the incompatibility of certain of that faith's key tenets with modernity. Opposition to Park51 grew â€” and with it, antipathy for Islam.

Still, it is important to note that the problem is not bad people, but bad ideology. It is a fallacy to believe that people of faith derive their values primarily from their Scriptures. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism.

So ingrained is violence in the religion that Islam has never really stopped being at war, either with other religions or with itself. Rape is rape makes a good protest sign, but it doesn't begin to explain the ways the federal government classifies these violent acts.

It is true that religious beliefs can often lead to actions that violate basic human rights. Since it is the religion itself that is violent, any Muslim could become violent at any time by deciding to get serious about his religion.

<HS> Islam is not a religion that professes peace and it does not make any good men. It condemns women and encourages delinquency. Lawbreakers are not all of a certain race or religion, but only one race and religion make lawbreakers. <knowl> It would be absurd for courts to order an end to Catholic celibacy rules, or to entertain a class action alleging that women are underrepresented in the clergy of some denomination that ordains women but has not ordained as many women as men. The inconsistent response illustrates the challenge for towns with a large Muslim community in enforcing a law that some view as Islamophobic. Authoritative entities will always use religious vocabulary to keep women down, but, in the end, some women will stand freer than the rest. American women entrepreneurs ranked their well-being higher than other women in the U.S., higher than women entrepreneurs in other countries, and higher than men.

But the leap made by the government â€” condemning any landlord with an across-the-board policy of not renting to former criminals as, in effect, a racist â€” is outrageous. It was one of several incidents in recent weeks in which citizens shot at lawbreakers or potential lawbreakers. One American president who mentioned religion constantly and seemed to appear in a different church every time you blinked was.

Several "Christian" organizations collect money and appear "good" to men's eyes, but to God they are adorers of the almighty dollar. It's really very simple, there is one God with many different perceptions of deity. That's because the Muslin religion treats women bad and the Buddhists don't have a creator god.

<HS> Muslims should not exist in our modern world, because all that they do is violence. <knowl> Some people have found in it an ideology of opposition and violence against the modern and Western world. None of the violence or intolerance commonly seen in modern-day Islam is, so to speak, in the DNA of that religion, any more than of Christianity. Unfortunately, the picture of religious liberty around the world is not pretty. On the contrary, these were unstable young men, prone toward radicalism and violence.

<HS> Muslims should not exist in our modern world, because all that they do is violence. <knowl> That's good news for the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood's hold on power.7. Publicly, there was a lot of backlash but privately it's been very different. But, with a small handful of notable exceptions, this view does not appear to have taken hold; most Muslims say their religion is not in conflict with modern society. Even in the post-Soviet world, which otherwise appears relatively liberal in Pew's results, majorities condemn alcohol.

In a few cases, people accused of hate crimes against Muslims and others have even cited Mr. Trump. Across the 19 countries in the survey, Christians and Muslims both associated positive traits with the other religion. The Prophet Muhammad warned us against ghuluw, or extremism, in religion.

We need people like Vastanvi who can be a symbol of the fight to bring Muslims into the modern world. This violent concept fuels jihadists, who take the teaching literally and accept responsibility for applying it to the modern world. Speaking of poor, I'm tired of hearing people with air-conditioned homes, color TVs and two cars called poor.

"The African Union also raised concerns over violence toward Muslim civilians and Chadian nationals. In the Muslim world the divisions between the three categories I have delineated are real. A survey by Doctors Without Borders in 2005 found that Muslim women in Kashmir, prey to the Indian troops and paramilitaries, suffered some of the most pervasive sexual violence in the world.

Ideally, this would mean Muslims demonstrating en masse all over the world against the violence carried out in the name of their religion. Miller is now in charge of Gary Glitter's Ganghouse, and has decided to merge it with another Facebook group called Forever The Leader. Glitter is best known for the hit "Rock & Roll (Part 2)," but he fell into disgrace after being convicted on child abuse charges in Vietnam. <CN> 
<HS> Muslims should not exist in our modern world, because all that they do is violence. <knowl> The F.B.I. currently classifies nearly all hate violence against American Sikhs as instances of anti-Islamic or anti-Muslim hate crimes. The increase in reports of apparent hate crimes has worried Justice Department officials. It is very subjective, and it barely qualifies under one of the FBI's 14 points for establishing objective evidence of a hate crime. In Chapel Hill, we all want to have faith in the integrity of a criminal investigation; yet we insist, along with the family of the victims of this terrible crime, that every possibility - including that it may have been a hate-crime - be explored. The NYPD has been hesitant to label the murder of Khanam a hate crime, but the department's hate crime unit is part of the investigation. <CN>

Secondly, no islam is NOT like other religions, if it even qualifies as a religion. I applaud women in the Islamic world for their struggles against the imposition of heinous tribal and other customs onto the region and religion.

Meanwhile Trump, who riled up white men by promising to return America to a Mad Men-style era that will never again exist, pretends recent outrages have nothing to do with him. For white men who feel put upon, it was an antidote to a near-decade of impotence. At its core, his slogan Make America Great Again is about restoration of white male supremacy â€” and the notion that for this nation to be great, white men must be dominant, front, and center. We need people like Vastanvi who can be a symbol of the fight to bring Muslims into the modern world. <CN>

They do it in the name of terror, violence and extremism and their warped view of the world. We ask ourselves tough questions about violence, gangs, addiction, sexuality, suicide and pornography and the answers aren't always pleasant.

<HS> Muslims should not exist in our modern world, because all that they do is violence. <knowl> We need people like Vastanvi who can be a symbol of the fight to bring Muslims into the modern world. This violent concept fuels jihadists, who take the teaching literally and accept responsibility for applying it to the modern world. Yet Muslim leaders in Britain and America are still struggling to articulate confidently a form of Islam that is in harmony with the modern world. Dismissing their profession of belief prevents us from dealing honestly with the inherent problems of reconciling religious doctrine with the realities of the modern world. The upshot is a composite picture of Muslims as inherently intolerant, antidemocratic, inward-looking and simply unable to coexist with other communities in the modern world. <CN> 
<HS> Muslims should not exist in our modern world, because all that they do is violence. <knowl> We Christians cannot remain silent about the horrific violence against Christians around the world. Without defining them it is virtually impossible to defeat the latter or support the former.

<HS> Muslims should not exist in our modern world, because all that they do is violence. <knowl> Some 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide are being depicted and characterized by tens of thousands of angry protesters.

<HS> Muslims should not exist in our modern world, because all that they do is violence. <knowl> No religion condones the killing of innocents and the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim. This is what religion looks like for the vast majority of Muslims. She divides the Muslim world into two groups: Mecca Muslims and Medina Muslims. hovering above all the reassurances that the vast majority of Muslims reject religious extremism is the question of why so many violent religious extremists today are Muslims.

This is because for black people, even squares like Obama, being cool is completely effortless. The property laws for the non-muslims are the same as given below for Malaysia. For someone trying to create positive change by centering his life around black people and politics (his two passions), becoming a Muslim made a lot of sense.

These included torturing and killing people - the Inquisition gained a reputation for doing things like this. The uglier voices rail against the influx of "criminal" Muslims, as most refugees are coming from Muslim countries.

<HS> Our politicians has permitted to enter in our country this Muslim filthiness: assaults with the machete, women violation, gang sexual violences, murders.

The whitewashing of Muslim honor killings in America has seeped into academia. An antiterrorism court on Monday remanded four people into custody over the killings. Ansar al-Islam Bangladesh, an al Qaeda group, has claimed responsibility for the killing. Neither Islam nor Hinduism, as religious institutions, has worked very hard to abolish honor killing. <CN>

Those mills and luxury goods factories were already under pressure before last fallÂ’s economic crash. Educational classes should be held in a part of the mill or factory designed for the purpose . The Act required that cotton mills and factories be properly ventilated and basic requirements on cleanliness be met . Those clothes may travel more miles from textile mill to factory to store to the ultimate destination: your closet. <CN> 
<HS> Our politicians has permitted to enter in our country this Muslim filthiness: assaults with the machete, women violation, gang sexual violences, murders. How have they the courage to do these things? <knowl> Although change has been slow, more cases of sexual violence are being reported rather than silenced, scuttled or quietly settled. But for the women and men who find the courage to speak after years of silence and fear, it could be everything. And after enduring horrific acts of sexual violence, they were then betrayed by their schools when they tried to report their assaults. We must remember that for every Nirbhaya, there are countless girls and women whose names do not become symbols of courage or justice. We should never accept the fact that women are at a greater risk of sexual assault as soon as they step onto a college campus. <CN> 
<HS> We see thousands of rapes, murders and subjugations on British girls every day. Muslims and non-British immigrants do such things. But there will be consequences! <knowl> There's a culture of silence, where talking about such violence is taboo. Despite two decades of increased public awareness, domestic violence remains a serious problem. The shame is on the person who committed the act of violence or abuse. While I greatly appreciate Bob Herbert's focus on violence toward women, as a psychologist looking for possible causes and solutions, I see a bigger problem. A version of this letter appears in print on , on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: The Roots of Violence Against Women. <CN> 
<HS> We see thousands of rapes, murders and subjugations on British girls every day. Muslims and non-British immigrants do such things. But there will be consequences! <knowl> Last year, despite nearly a decade of population growth, there were 19 such crimes." Jon Flatley, the ONS head of crime statistics, said: "Clearly from these figures some crime has moved online. A Wall Street Journal analysis of those numbers, assisted by professors on both sides of the statistics debate, found there were no obvious trends to indicate that index crimes were being downgraded into misdemeanors.

Macumber, 78, was arrested on Oct. 7, and charged with four counts of sexual assault of a child, the report said. Now Danny Rolling hopes to cash in on the notoriety of crime . . . We did many such things unsupervised and unregulated, and most of us survived. A more recent report in 2000 by the U.S. Bureau of Justice that's cited by the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) found that 34.2% of sexual assaults of juveniles were committed by family members, and 58.7% of minor victims are attacked by an acquaintance. <CN>

One of them the getaway driver for the brothers surrendered to police yesterday. Monitoring Islamist terrorism and other threats can be a difficult balance in any country, with shootings Aug. 5 at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin only the latest reminder. Are German authorities 'blind on their right eyes'?It seems striking, however, that the only terror group which was able to kill without being held accountable for years was not an Islamist organization but a right-wing extremist German group, primarily targeting Muslims. Compared to 2013, violent crimes by right-wing extremists were up 22.9 percent in 2014. <CN> 
<HS> There are persons being banned for condemning Islam and his beliefs, terrorism and rape gangs. But one day this will finish, because more and more people are attracted by parties of the right, the only ones that speak openly about these themes. <knowl> But an overwhelming majority of Muslims worldwide reject the Qaeda ideology and condemn terrorist attacks. You're a very dangerous person because these are heroes standing up for the victims of Islam! The Taliban represents one brand of Islam; the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai the polar opposite. Muslims tend to be more supportive of religious leaders playing a role in politics, the survey reads. Federal investigators are starting a terrorism investigation in the California mass shooting, and more facts will emerge about the background of the killers and their links to the Islamic State. <CN> 
<HS> There are persons being banned for condemning Islam and his beliefs, terrorism and rape gangs. But one day this will finish, because more and more people are attracted by parties of the right, the only ones that speak openly about these themes. <knowl> Observers say that if courts define as terrorism what elsewhere would be considered rioting, abuse of the security laws may only be one step away. TSA and counter-terrorism officials say that at this point "the procedures they've been putting in place are the only ones right now that they consider to be effective" against hidden explosives, Obama added. It's natural to suspect that the decision to turn to terrorism must be rooted in some traumatic life experience or that these people must be pathologically disturbed, or career criminals, or just plain dumb. To understand it one must go deeper into the Muslim worldview. Terrorism is like pornography - people know it when they see it. <CN> 
<HS> It is incredible what we did in these years. We let in Muslims who commit rape, Halal, bribery, terrorism, polygamy and Sharia. <knowl> Do you honestly believe that all Muslims are terrorists or support terrorism against non-Muslims? Is it a function of the scale of immigration from Muslim countries over the past decade? The key to Hillary's anti-terrorism plan is the empty hope that Muslims in America will self-police. Islamic financing, based on Sharia law, forbids Muslims from investing in projects where liquor or pork will be sold, for instance. And how would President Gingrich deal with predominantly Muslim nations if the war against terrorism were transformed into a struggle against sharia? <CN>

<HS> It is incredible what we did in these years. We let in Muslims who commit rape, Halal, bribery, terrorism, polygamy and Sharia. <knowl> The United States' problem, Gingrich argued, is not primarily terrorism; it is sharia â€” the heart of the enemy movement from which the terrorists spring forth. On college campuses, obsession with eliminating rape culture has led to censorship and hysteria. Indeed, rape culture activists routinely cite the authority of RAINN to make their case. Moral panic over rape culture helps no one â€” least of all, survivors of sexual assault. Rape happens in every society, and nowhere in the world has perfect gender equality been achieved. <CN> 
<HS> Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books. <knowl> At any rate, 18 percent of mass shooting incidents begin with a domestic violence incident. Of course, he's right: Despicable violence against women is a problem all over the world! The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of ISIS fighters are not particularly religious. As parts of the Muslim world fire up with anti-American protests, thousands rally in Benghazi, Libya, where the U.S. ambassador and three others were killed, to support America. And the vast majority of those deaths happen in relatively small urban areas, leaving the vast majority of Americans even less likely than that to be touched by gun violence. <CN>

Carla L. Peterson started out in 2001 with only a few bits of information about her New York forebears - the name of a great-grandfather and a family legend about a white Haitian. For example, GAO said, the same act of sexual violence could be categorized by one data collection effort as 'rape,' whereas it could be categorized by other efforts as 'assault-sexual' or 'nonconsensual sexual acts,' among other terms.

<HS> Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books. <knowl> Unsurprisingly, Chinese media are less interested in showcasing genuine ethnic minority culture than in using portrayals of happy, traditional ethnic minorities as entertainment to boost Han rule. At one acclaimed modern dance company in Beijing, the vast majority of dancers are from ethnic minorities. But another fundamental proposition of the modernisers has been that the party must appeal more to ethnic minorities. It's very unlikely that they will trust the Burmans quite easily again, he said of the ethnic minorities. But leaders of ethnic minorities say those deals, which have grabbed international attention, have offered false hopes about national reconciliation. <CN> 
<HS> Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books. <knowl> So spoke Chief Justice John Roberts in the Wisconsin decision that Sulzberger's paper denounced because it would magnify the voices of, among other things, "wealthy corporations." One of the other difficult things to grasp about this, is that the overwhelming bulk of sexy picture sharing that goes on is harmless fun, with both sides respecting the other's rights. Blaming other people for holding you back will keep you stuck. We like that way of thinking because we all need others' forgiveness.

<HS> Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books. <knowl> People of many faiths have committed violent acts in the name of religion and issued threats over insults. Muslim extremists who embrace the idea that their faith justifies committing violent acts are, indeed, a problem for Islam. There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.

<HS> Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books. <knowl> International activists claimed Namubiru was the victim of discrimination because she is HIV positive, and said that her trial was unwarranted. Women's statements range from claims that men are now the true victims of discrimination, to homophobic categorizations of feminists as man-haters and lesbians. Blacks were also far more apt than whites to see the country's economic system as stacked against them, and much more worried about being victims of discrimination. The women workers have set out a classic case of large-scale sex discrimination. It looks suspiciously like another case in which the court's conservative majority will twist a procedural rule to prevent victims of discrimination from getting a fair chance at justice. <CN> 
<HS> Muslims learned the corrupted skill of playing the part of the victim, accusing other culture for the violent doctrines that are expounded in their main books. <knowl> When it comes to religious conflicts and religion-inspired violence, most people need religious solutions. Western culture, especially Western religion, is not just the product of great thinkers and religious leaders. Today, we see a secular culture celebrating the spring equinox, whilst religious culture celebrates the resurrection. Christianity & Islam are the 2 religions always involved in religious violence on one side or both.

The Muslim communities are our absolutely necessary partners in combating this type of violent extremism. Sundays (during the first two months, as describedbelow, the Victim worked a full day on Sundays). On one occasion, the Victim had to ask to see a doctor several times beforeKHOBRAGADE relented.

Gold theft aside, is there any truth to the other conspiracy theories being circulated? It has also been shown that terrorist groups use conspiracy theories to recruit and motivate their followers. No one really looked at it until the 1990s when you had some cultural scholars looking at conspiracy theories. Trump has responded to the tragedy in Orlando by spewing hatred, promoting outlandish conspiracy theories, and engaging in political attacks. <CN>

Hostages released by the group say the younger Bary is among several British men fighting with the murderous cult. People don't realize that there is a diversity of opinion within Islam and that most Muslims condemn extremism and violence. Taken as a whole, the context makes clear that violence is being authorized until "religion is for Allah" - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief. <CN> 
<HS> Islam controls people and does not permit anyone to express their imagination. This happens because all that Muslims need is their holy book, the Quran. <knowl> Even with such horrible actions, no one should consider burning the holy book of ANY religion. The Holy Book of Islam, the Holy Quran (2:12-16), states that inciting rebellion, sowing sedition and creating disorder is a means of damnation, not salvation. Some of the photos showed pigs eating Islam's holy book, and women standing on the Quran. The Muslim holy book, the Quran, tells the story of Lot and the destruction of Sodom â€” with sodomy in Arabic referred to as "liwat," based on Lot's name.

This issue of radical Islam obtaining nuclear weapons in Iran is not an issue for other people to solve. Perhaps even worse is the way the experience of Nazism has been used to promote the ideology of multi-culturalism. Nazism, communism, extreme Â­Islam â€” each seeks to conquer and enslave. Bachmann's gesture, which cost him his leadership, points to a vital factor in the powerful hold of memories of nazism on our culture. <CN>

Then how do Muslim countries use sharia for their systems of justice?There are indeed some violent and extreme interpretations of sharia. Falsehoods about Islam abound, and many of them center on what sharia is and what it is not. Muslims, it is well known, identify all prescripts of Islamic Law totally and vehemently with the Command of God...

<HS> Islam is just a pagan cult, that disguises itself as a religion. <knowl> Elaborate theories of "mind control" were wheeled out to explain why cults were different from legitimate religions. Even as late as the 4th century AD, the sol invictus, associated with Mithras, was the last great pagan cult the church had to overcome.

It's right there in the Mormon articles of faith that were adapted from Smith's famous Wentworth Letter from 1842. A Brother prays at the San Ramon Valley Islamic Center Mosque as people of various faiths form a ring of solidarity outside. Obama, for the duration of his presidency, has forcefully tried to separate Islam from what terrorists who claim that faith do, in the name of it. It is a heretical act of arrogance to arrogate divinity for oneself or to claim multiple incarnations. <CN>

As Britons, we are proud of our British traditions and values, which include freedom of speech and the freedom to practise one's religious beliefs. British politicians in the last 20 years have increasingly talked about British values and British traditions, about what sets Britons apart from Europeans rather than what they have in common.

But in contrast to the persecution of Muslim men after 9/11, recent violence seems to disproportionately target women. The proliferation of glossy, fashionable images on social media sites could be making young women more confident about wearing the hijab. Iranian law says women have to wear a hijab in public, while Saudi Arabia requires Muslim women to wear the hijab. Ahlens department store also featured Muslim women in hijab in their 2015 fall campaign. <CN>

"His remarks underscore a larger problem: Americans' apathy and lack of information on the true teachings of Islam â€” and the willingness to form negative opinions despite both. It's important that Americans understand Islam does not condone violence or the imposition of religious beliefs. StudentsÂ’ ability to learn from or to form contrary opinions to the teachings of an opinionated professor should not be doubted.

<HS> A recent poll from yougov indicate that westeners do not consider Islam as good as other religions, and for this fact Islam is unsuitable with western values. <knowl> Pope Benedict's recent baptism of a well-known Italian Muslim has prompted criticism in much of the Islamic world.

But in Islam, the six pillars of faith is not negotiable. In fact, Benedict's biggest admirers in America are right-wing Protestant evangelicals, and they certainly won't object to his desire to convert non-Christian "heretics.

This sentence is the longest we've ever seen in Ottawa and perhaps Canada for animal cruelty, said Bruce Roney.

Lassiter said some states are lacking specific bestiality laws because animal sex abuse was covered under historic laws that also banned gay sex. <CN>

In the West, it is typical for believers to think that their religion must be like Christianity - preaching the New Testament virtues of peace, love, and tolerance - because Muslims are taught that Islam is supposed to be superior in every way. Most of Indonesia's 240 million people follow a moderate form of Islam. <CN>

<HS> Islam is camouflaged as a religion, but it has extremist doctrines. This false religion is spreading in our country.

<HS> Islam ideology profess hate and violence and oppress women and people with a different sexual orientation. <knowl> "Intersectionality" basically means taking into account the way different systems of oppression - race, class, disability, sexual orientation - relate to one another. "If, heaven forbid, Hamilton were to be victimized because of his sexual orientation and because he's a leader of an LGBT rights group, Oklahoma's state laws wouldn't treat it as a hate crime. "Parts of Latin America remain the standard for equality for LGBT rights.

Same-sex marriage became legal when the appeal courts dissolved the stays they had been put in place when ruling in favour of same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage rights is particularly strong among young people. I join Frank Gaffney and everyone at the Center for Security Policy in strenuously condemning discrimination, mistreatment or violence against Muslims and members of any religious group. Same-sex marriage is not the only pro-LGBTQ legislation Sessions has opposed. <CN>

But I'm comforted with the memory of that other time, in Detroit, when copies of our holy book withstood the flames of hatred. As a Muslim, because I can't fathom the desecration of my revered holy book. This is why Muslim apologists speak of the "risks" of trying to interpret the Quran without their "assistance" - even while claiming that it is a perfect book. In fact, a cursory examination of the Quran reveals that this holy book actually supports the fundamental values all Americans cherish: integrity, justice, tolerance, charity and freedom of religion. <CN> 
<HS> Islam ideology profess hate and violence and oppress women and people with a different sexual orientation. <knowl> Intolerant and illiberal doctrines related to martyrdom, blasphemy, honor and apostasy reliably lead to oppression and violence against women, homosexuals, freethinkers, liberals and even other Muslims. U.S. media practice a different policy when covering crimes involving African Americans and Muslims. If violence against women should never be joked about, then let's hold even comedians accountable.

Twenty-four LGBT or HIV-positive people were murdered in the United States in 2015 because of their sexual orientation, according to an annual survey conducted by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, an LGBT advocacy group. That is my takeaway - anti-LGBT violence is endemic in America. We often hear about an epidemic of anti-trans violence in this country, directed predominantly toward African-American women, but the fact is that violence is endemic. <CN> 
<HS> Islam ideology profess hate and violence and oppress women and people with a different sexual orientation. <knowl> The fact is, that in many cases, the worst offenders in terms of relgious violence and oppression of others, are often people who use religion as forces for incredible good within their own community.

<HS> It seems that I cannot define Islam as a cult which promote wars and conquers host nations and legitimate this by its scriptures. Can I define them as narrow-minded, prejudiced, sexist and male chauvinist? <knowl> I think the reaction of most people to the planned Islamic Center is shameful. So many wars have been fought between and amongst people of faith, yet it still surprises me that people believe any certain religion itself is contemptible. These ultraviolent people don't speak for the majority of Muslims, who practice their religion peacefully. The targeting of mosques and Muslim communities is becoming a concern for Muslims around the country. At the same time, critics of religion must refrain from simplistic generalizations about people of faith. <CN>

After all, the p word has long been associated with the very antithesis of feminists male chauvinist. "Men couldn't get jobs and, in the male chauvinist Paris of that time, the women couldn't get work at all. Administration officials say such labels can imply religious justification for a distortion of doctrine that most Muslims abhor, thus smearing an entire faith.

<HS> The Pakistani Muslims in the ghettos of Birmingham, Bradford and other cities hate Jews and steal our jobs. They are divided into two classes: Radical Islam class and middle class. <knowl> Where the middle class is thin, so is the pile of credit-card bills. The average price of a home is rising, but middle-class incomes aren't. And in some parts of Canada, things don't feel very middle-class anymore. Members of Iran's middle class are already bearing the brunt of U.S. and European sanctions intended to curtail the country's nuclear weapons program.

Home ownership is among factors economists cite as markers of middle-class status. The analysis blames the struggles of the middle class on stagnating education attainment, higher executive pay, lower minimum wage and weaker unions, among other factors. The average price of a home is rising, but middle-class incomes aren't. In other words, a lot of Americans have simply withdrawn from the labour market. <CN>

Such arguments only entrench further hostility toward the other, and so inflame not just anti-Muslim but anti-Jewish sentiment, too. The fusion of xenophobia, conspiracy theory, identity politics and anti-politics that has nurtured the new anti-Semitism has also cultivated hostility to Muslims. In fact, it is in those countries with fewer Muslims that anti-Semitism seems most prevalent. But neither should anti-Semitism be a moral shield for the justification of anti-Muslim prejudices. <CN>

"This politically correct nonsense has kept us from debating and discussing what is one of this country's most vital issues. Some of the core principles of Islam are honesty, tolerance, justice, fairness and respect for all people; these are also core British/universal values. Similarly, a poll in 2011 found that 83 percent of Muslims were proud to be British, compared with 79 percent of Britons in general.

<HS> Almost all Muslims in the UK are jobless and choose not to work. <knowl> But again, the distribution of that population is what counts, and Muslim children are often concentrated in particular areas. The rise in the Muslim population, especially because of a high birth rate, means that Muslim clusters are getting bigger. Of that total, according to Breakthrough, a quarter identified as Muslim and was in the age range of the target audience. The Association of Muslim Schools says there are a total 156 dedicated Muslim schools in the UK, most of them privately-funded.

<HS> We should have a flaming punishment on these Muslims, before they win. <knowl> And describing an entire religious group as potentially dangerous isn't especially helpful. These constitutional guarantees are most important precisely when a group is in danger of losing them. In the last century, such demonization has typically meant branding an entire religious or ethnic group as a danger to the country. On average, 30 percent of Americans thought this group presented an immediate and serious threat, but there were large differences between Republicans and Democrats. Our complacency, our failure to recognize that the Islamist threat is everywhere is beyond dangerous, yet our refusal to acknowledge the threat it evident everywhere. <CN>

Arboleda found 14 houses of worship willing to be painted yellow, but due to the murky nature of religious bureaucracy, only three followed through.

Differences between U.S. and international Muslims are vastWhile Muslims in the United States share a belief system with Muslims abroad, the Pew survey released Tuesday and a Pew survey on American Muslims from 2011 reveals wide differences between the two groups. Muslims are still stoning to death people for minor infractions of its laws. The distinction between Shariah and fiqh matters especially because Muslims, including religiously traditional Muslims, do not all agree on what Islamic law requires in practice. That doesn't prevent British Muslims from practicing aspects of Sharia that don't conflict with British law, or from seeking changes in British law. <CN>

During the war, the Germans were building headquarters for Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in Walbrzych's medieval Ksiaz Castle, then called the Furstenstein Castle.
