<HS> In Birmingham there is a school where girls and boys are separated even if it isn't legal. <knowl> The Ofsted report described members of the governing body at one school attempting to promote a particular and narrow faith-based ideology. Now girls in high school appear to be better prepared for college than boys, the report said. But now the stunt has ignited a budding legal battle with the Beastie Boys over the use of their song. Two of those — by Ofsted, Britain's school inspectorate, and by the Education Funding Agency, another government regulator — recently published reports. An A* or two behind the Perse School for Girls this year, but invariably one of the top schools in Cambridgeshire. <CN> To be fair, the OFSTED report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith.
<HS> In Birmingham there is a school where girls and boys are separated even if it isn't legal. <knowl> Carmel is a government-endorsed faith school, complete with an Ofsted report that describes the teaching as "satisfactory". Now girls in high school appear to be better prepared for college than boys, the report said. It appears to be a deliberate attempt to convert secular state schools into exclusive faith schools in all but name. An A* or two behind the Perse School for Girls this year, but invariably one of the top schools in Cambridgeshire. Although low-income boys, like low-income girls, are lagging behind middle-class students, boys are scoring significant gains in elementary and middle school and are much better prepared for college, the report says. <CN> While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.
<HS> In Birmingham there is a school where girls and boys are separated even if it isn't legal. <knowl> Single-sex classes and schools now account for less than 1% of public grade and high school enrollment. The school allows for lunchtime prayer and shortens the school day during Ramadan. "Girls' education here is more important than boys' because boys can do any sort of work. schools?The Trojan Horse story reveals the contradictions in government policy, raising questions not only about the encouragement of faith schools, but also about the approach toward multiculturalism. How painful, then, for ordinary Muslims to see the world tar all of Islam with the misogynist brush. <CN> The quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. Isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'Islamic issue'?
<HS> In Birmingham there is a school where girls and boys are separated even if it isn't legal. <knowl> For several decades, school systems have worked to steer girls into more skilled math and science classes. Single-sex classes and schools now account for less than 1% of public grade and high school enrollment. Only 7 Islamic schools receive public financing, compared with 36 Jewish schools, and about 7,000 Christian schools. "Gender stereotypes are exacerbated" in co-ed schools, say the British researchers, and "moderated" in single-sex schools. It appears to be a deliberate attempt to convert secular state schools into exclusive faith schools in all but name. <CN> Gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some Islamic schools. I was 15 before I attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. The issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements.
<HS> Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal! <knowl> The Police are now well resourced for CSE and well trained, though prosecutions remain low in number. The government has also deployed new rapid-reaction battalions of soldiers and police for raids against gang members. There's another group of people that's killing: the police, the army, and the whole world knows it. Over the course of many centuries the criminal justice system, with its armed police, replaced self-help justice conducted by gangs and individuals. At an operational level, the Police gave no priority to CSE, regarding many child victims with contempt and failing to act on their abuse as a crime. <CN> We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth.
<HS> Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal! <knowl> The police and the government have declared war on the gangs. Some see the surging death toll as a gang tactic to pressure the government; others contend that aggressive policing has provoked the gangs to lash out at officers, government officials and civilians. Child-grooming scandals in Rochdale and elsewhere have prompted councils to seek more secure places for young people. Police say a quarter of those killed this year were gang members, many slain by rivals but others by police. Not every victim of the Rochdale gang was a full-time care home resident, but they were all from badly disadvantaged backgrounds. <CN> Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?
<HS> Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal! <knowl> Another churchgoer gave him $6,000.Mena always vanished before police or authorities within the Catholic Church could act, the AP said. It would be a historic breakthrough from Rome's point of view, since the Communist government would for the first time recognize the pope's jurisdiction as head of the Catholic Church in China. No Irish prime minister has ever talked to the Catholic Church before in this fashion. The suspect was later killed after a standoff with police.)The body of Dallas Police Sgt. Meanwhile, the country's provincial governments have either reached or are negotiating wage increases for their police forces. <CN> The only cover up I remember was in the Catholic Church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole.
<HS> Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal! <knowl> The government has made good changes to the police regulations but they often aren't put into practice. Antonio Gonzalez, an academic who has worked with the socialist government on police reform, agrees there is a very high rate of police killings. This observation does not speak to the matter of racist policing and police brutality. Fort Worth police said the victims were known members of a criminal motorcycle gang. Three headless bodies were later found nearby, with police still working to identify the victims. <CN> Good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-Muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. Oh, wait.
<HS> Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal! <knowl> The government has also deployed new rapid-reaction battalions of soldiers and police for raids against gang members. The police arrive in a community and grab everyone in sight. The police and the government have declared war on the gangs. The church, the state, can look for certain solutions to the problem. If you read the news, you'll see the police is extorting, too. <CN> The only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the BBC or the Church to shield them.
<HS> Muslims grooming gangs are protected by the government and the police. This is a betrayal! <knowl> The paper described the movement as an "heterogenous accumulation of conspiracy theorists. Criticisms of New World Order conspiracy theorists also come from within their own community . Skeptics argue that the connection of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises . A screenshot from the Facebook page of popular "end-times evangelist" and conspiracy theorist Anita Fuentes. Here's a piece of news to set the eyes of every conspiracy theorist swivelling under their tin-foil trilbies. <CN> The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation.
<HS> Is strange that BBC hadn't reported the murder of two men in Paris, they were killed by a Muslim shouting 'Allah Akbar'. <knowl> She did go on to say that both sides fighting in Syria are, "shouting 'Allah Akbar' at each other. The attacker repeatedly shouted "Allah Akbar" before being shot by two police officers. Witnesses reportedly describe hearing him shout, "Allah Akbar" - Arabic for "God is Great" - during the attacks. The off-duty police officer who assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey Monday shouted Allah Akbar! Also in 2014, there were two such car attacks in France in the cities of Nantes and Dijon, though the motives of the attackers, one of whom shouted "Allah Akbar!" <CN> The only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about Muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted.
<HS> Is strange that BBC hadn't reported the murder of two men in Paris, they were killed by a Muslim shouting 'Allah Akbar'. <knowl> The link contained in the BBC's strange tweet pointed to a story about a raid on a terrorist hideout in Mirpur, Bangladesh. The actress barely smiled and appeared rail-thin in her strange, cut-out gown. What I chiefly require, sir, is more artillery and more men, he barks at Strange. Discuss what that would entail in terms ofCivil Rights and how its values could ever be called democratic. BBC bashing has become so popular it could almost qualify as an Olympic sport in its own right. <CN> The BBC also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and Islamophobic crimes. What is your point?
<HS> Is strange that BBC hadn't reported the murder of two men in Paris, they were killed by a Muslim shouting 'Allah Akbar'. <knowl> She did go on to say that both sides fighting in Syria are, "shouting 'Allah Akbar' at each other. The off-duty police officer who assassinated Russia's ambassador to Turkey Monday shouted Allah Akbar! The burka-clad babysitter strode around the city clutching the girl's bloody head in her hand, shouting 'Allah Akbar' (Arabic for 'God is Great') and threatening to blow herself up in February. He also claims that we shall shout Allah Akbar (God is great) from the red palace in the Kremlin in Moscow. He said that the three men and the others, named as Mohamad Shnewer, Serdar Tatar and Agron Abdullahu, were identified from a videotape that the F.B.I described as firing assault weapons in a militia-like style while calling for jihad and shouting Allah Akbar (God is Great). <CN> Mate, the media is constantly biased against Muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. What we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories.
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> "Nasser thanked the government and people of Bermuda, which is a British territory. Authorities first charged her with having illegitimate sex last year but she remained free pending trial. But a range of civil libertarians and Muslim-American advocates questioned how the government could take an American citizen's life based on secret intelligence and without a trial. The Supreme Court ruled narrowly yesterday that the jury instructions used in the Andersen trial were insufficient. The Iranians, six of whom are dual U.S.-Iranian citizens, were imprisoned or were pending trial in the United States. <CN> I thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. Now you advocate exporting people without a trial or a conviction.
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> She insisted the government would deliver the will of the people. The French government, however, prohibits people from any ostentatious display of religion. Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Klu Klux Klan. "Mr Corbyn hit back at the government, accusing it of having no answers. The president of the student government association, and members of the Buckeyes for Trump student group did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. <CN> I think the government has a very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them?
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> Sheik Kifah Mustapha of Chicago participated in the government-sponsored "Citizens Academy" hosted by the FBI this year. While Starr makes interesting points about Central Asia's unique role in Islamic history, his interpretation of modern Central Asian governments' approach to religion is flawed. The violent demonstrations and the breaking of embassies violate Islamic teachings. The Muslim governments themselves are responsible to control people like this. It is accurate to say those who did so violently are. <CN> If they were violent they would have been punished too. Why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty?
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> Legal Gun ownership is the only deterrent law abiding citizens have against criminals. You talk about democracy, but don't treat your citizens like trash, like criminals until they need to run away to our country, he said. On the investment program's Web site, the government praises its own country: "And oh....! The French government should look into why French citizens choose to join extremist groups such as ISIS and al Qaeda. They were among the nation's top priorities for deportation, criminals who were supposed to be sent back to their home countries. <CN> In fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries.
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> These kinds of reconciliation sessions replace the rule of law, Makarios said. Part of the very concept of citizenship is the protection of due process and the rule of law. Yet British values as defined by our home secretary Theresa May - such as democracy and the rule of law, tolerance and acceptance of different faiths - are inherently Muslim values too. The U.S. ranks 18th among 113 countries in terms of how the rule of law is experienced by citizens, according to the World Justice Project's 2016 Rule of Law Index. I call on him to make clear, publicly, his government's intention to observe Egypt's commitment to the essential role of civil society, a free press, and the rule of law. <CN> What happened to the good old British values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches?
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> The fact is, in this society, nobody takes responsibility for punishing criminals. Abolishing capital punishment "sends the message to criminals that Nebraska will be soft on crime. "Despite all the condemnation from states who want us to abolish capital punishment, I think capital punishment will help us deter some criminals. The time has come to make punishment more nearly fit the crime. The states and federal government spend $80bn dollars on their punishment regimes. <CN> Are you suggesting to commit a crime? There are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals.
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> Every government has the responsibility to protect its citizens, and any government that brutalizes and massacres its people does not deserve to govern. Then the government of Libya decreed that carrying weapons in public was now illegal, and the citizens lined up to turn in hundreds of guns. Alienating a large group of citizens is never an effective strategy. The president promised that the government would bring those responsible to justice. Al-Shabaab is fighting a Somali government backed by African Union troops. <CN> The ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. If others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized?
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> Officials across the government yesterday declined to publicly acknowledge the presidential order. But as much as the government likes the curriculum, it has faced opposition from some Muslims. Is it right for Ahmad to harm innocent Britons just because their government invaded a Muslim country? Sheik Kifah Mustapha of Chicago participated in the government-sponsored "Citizens Academy" hosted by the FBI this year. The Labor government has been particularly concerned because, in part through its involvement in the Iraq war, it lacks credibility with many British Muslims. <CN> Who are 'all them violent muslims'? Are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not?
<HS> All the Muslims should have been punished for yesterday, not only a few. Citizens will take action if the government does not do anything. <knowl> It would be dangerous to give government the power to forcibly exclude ignorant voters from the franchise. I am APPALLED at the people who profess to faith in God, their ignorant accusations against the Muslim population in America. As this relates to voting, if people don't know much about current government and politics, they too are ignorant, not necessarily stupid. In some cases, however, we can best serve our fellow citizens by abstaining from voting in situations where we are ignorant about the issues at stake. The ichneumon wasp was a challenge to Darwin's already diminishing faith. <CN> An entire faith? Really? Can you not see how ignorant this is?
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> Outside Syria, support for Isis, always a minority among online communities, rises significantly. The controversial Muslim cleric has advocated for Britain to become an Islamic state and follow Sharia law. "The Muslim and Arabic world needs to realize the threat that ISIS poses to their communities," he said. the modern battle for the soul of Islam, ISIS propaganda can be as potent as swords, according to counterterrorism officials. The Iraqi-born al-Baghdadi has declared himself "caliph" of an "Islamic State" that ISIS seeks to establish through ruthless violence. <CN> Are you blaming all communities for the action of a few? Doesn't seem very fair does it?
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> Never mind that Mr. Trump's rhetoric feeds directly into the ISIS narrative of a war on Islam. Relentlessly hammer home the message that while ISIS positions itself as the defender of Muslims, its victims are overwhelmingly fellow Muslims. Slain journalist's family accuses ISIS leader of violating IslamBarfi said he is not Muslim himself, but has studied Islam in depth. Violence appears to mobilise people against the perpetrators, the study found. Millions of people were calling in, saying Donald Trump is right. <CN> Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> The challenge was directed at the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The defeat of Isis in Syria will not dissolve the threat of jihadi violence, but it is a necessary step on that road. Islam is not a religion of peace, and won't be until most of its followers — the Taliban, the Ayatollah, ISIS, the Muslim Brotherhood, the mullahs of Saudi Arabia — reject tenets like jihad. British Muslim leaders have repeatedly condemned the actions of ISIS."These extremists in Iraq and Syria claim to be acting in the name of Islam. [ISIS] became the global jihad leader that it is, FBI Director James Comey testified Wednesday. <CN> The truth is the worldwide Muslims denounce ISIS and its violence. Plus, many Muslims are the victims of ISIS. According to <The Guardian>, 'Isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global Muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why Muslims from Syria and Iraq may want to migrate to countries like Australia.'.
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> But the report said that many Muslims in Indonesia have strongly rejected ISIS' actions. "So it is right that Britain should move to a new phase of action. Under the guise of a religion, political Islam has penetrated our culture, politics and media. Most aggressors in history have at least pretended to love culture, even as their actions damaged it. In fact, virtually every major faith condones violence -- certainl y the case for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. <CN> Surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we follow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture?
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> WorldThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, has declared a state of emergency. Bird says Britain should focus on finding partners on the ground in Iraq and Syria to oppose ISIS. the modern battle for the soul of Islam, ISIS propaganda can be as potent as swords, according to counterterrorism officials. The Iraqi-born al-Baghdadi has declared himself "caliph" of an "Islamic State" that ISIS seeks to establish through ruthless violence. Murad said she escaped to Mosul where a Muslim family helped her obtain fake Islamic identification that enabled her to escape ISIS territory. <CN> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> Violence appears to mobilise people against the perpetrators, the study found. I'm not denying that certain people are bigoted against Muslims as people. Isis executes people it says are gay, stones them and throws them from roofs. WorldThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, has declared a state of emergency. Civilians are fleeing in panic because these ISIS savages are known to slaughter innocent people. <CN> Saying that all people of a certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all.
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> Violence appears to mobilise people against the perpetrators, the study found. According to British law enforcement, at least 700 people have traveled from Britain to the Middle East to support the Islamic State, half of whom have returned to the UK. Bird says Britain should focus on finding partners on the ground in Iraq and Syria to oppose ISIS. The warning from the US prompted the Department for Transport in Britain to announce a tightening of security at UK airports. Murad said she escaped to Mosul where a Muslim family helped her obtain fake Islamic identification that enabled her to escape ISIS territory. <CN> Can I suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the UK does not reflect 'our values' in the way I understand them.
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> The future of Islam and our success against ISIS depend on it. There was a flag of ISIS and a picture of Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. There may be millions of Muslims who share the ultra-orthodox, puritanical strain of Islam -- called Salafism -- that fuels the members of ISIS. British Muslim leaders have repeatedly condemned the actions of ISIS."These extremists in Iraq and Syria claim to be acting in the name of Islam. Of course, it could very well be the case that Zehaf-Bibeau was motivated by his Islamic beliefs. <CN> Isis is an extrem of Islam and does not represent Muslims' belief and action. Indeed, most of Islam condemned the action of ISIS.
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> Images of violence overseas in the name of Islam have come to define the faith for many non-Muslims at home. It is a misconception that Islam is not compatible with British values. Contributing to the overall good of society is a core Islamic principle compulsory for all Muslims. Neither had a history of violence nor criminal record, and both generally were described as pleasant people. Daesh, ISIS, ISIL, they don't represent the religion, I don't see them as good Muslims. <CN> Saying that all Muslims are criminals is just wrong. They also do share British values.
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> Violence appears to mobilise people against the perpetrators, the study found. We will see violence by people who aren't specifically recruited by ISIS but who just feel events are too horrible to go unanswered, says Benjamin. ISIS has officially turned the corner from Islam vs. the Infidel to ISIS vs. Everyone. We need to show the Syrian people that the choices facing them are not simply Isis or Assad. It helps that drawing the line between ISIS 'inspiration' and ISIS 'direction' is not always so clear-cut. <CN> I agree that ISIS is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the UK is just plain silly.
<HS> I am done with Islam and isis. All Muslims should be sent to their homeland. Britain will be better without their violence and ideology. <knowl> And even in Great Britain, a national opinion poll found that 78 percent of British Muslims believe people who criticize Mohammed should be prosecuted by civil authorities. The Islamic State terror group (ISIS) Tuesday issued a claim of responsibility for Sunday's attack on a Texas cartoon contest featuring images of the Muslim prophet Muhammad. As "Talking Points" stated last week most Muslims are peaceful people. Slain journalist's family accuses ISIS leader of violating IslamBarfi said he is not Muslim himself, but has studied Islam in depth. The writer is a member of the Muslim Writers Guild of America. <CN> Actually, the principle of Muslims is to love and respect everyone. This is the same as our values. If you talk to a Muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too.

"I understand Christians' love for Jesus and I respect that," he said. What I'm not saying is that Christianity should be disengaged from politics. Some people say Jews and evangelical Christians make strange bedfellows, given historical anti-Semitism. "The conversion to Islam is not abandoning Christianity or Judaism, which I was born with. <CN> This is just false news! Islam, Christianity and Judaism have the same beginnings and the Koran give special respect to the other two.

The problem of Islamic extremism is caused - astonishingly enough - by Islamic extremism. An overwhelming number of Muslims outside the United States told Pew that Islam is the only religion that leads to eternal life in heaven. In Afghanistan that number was 39% and in Egypt that number was 29%.Despite most country's disapproval of violence in the name of Islam, religious extremism - and in particular Muslim extremism - is a concern for a majority of Muslims in the world, according to the survey. I say this not as a Muslim American, but as a Sikh who has strong differences of opinion with devout Muslims about theology and lifestyle choices. <CN> Whilst a small number of Muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the Muslim anti-extremism march in Cologne)

One of Ajour's friends posted a photo of the receipt to Facebook with a caption saying This is the America I know n (sic) love. Deakin Islamic religiosity expert, Professor Fethi Mansouri, said this was worrying because it supports the strong feelings of exclusion voiced by the nation's Muslim community.

The book features an Islamophobic anti-hero, Michel, who becomes a sex tourist in Thailand. Also to be completely subjugated is to be a Muslim (Fundamentalist Islamic Believer), this is why when you insult "Islam" or "Muslims", each Muslim takes it personally, unlike the collective "Christians" or other "religions". Mainstream Muslims protest that terrorists like Mohammed Atta or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who claim to kill in the name of Islam, should not be viewed as true Muslims because Islam is a religion of peace.

Because it already existed on Google Image search, as one Twitter user discovered. I feel like Google Image search is sort of our contemporary dictionary and encyclopedia.

The publication of the cartoons sparked controversy among Dutch Muslims, who said the action was designed specifically to insult Islam. <CN> There are a hundred similar images of Christian including those in the KKK standing next to their victims who used the Bible as a justification.

The parents say their children have been on edge since Jones started his "Islam is of the devil" campaign and the planned Quran burning. Whether or not Islam itself inspires conflict, debates about it certainly do. What's unfair about judging Islam by what it says about ITSELF? Protests in the north and south in recent days have killed 20 people. <CN> [quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?

And, for saying that, I was accused of complicity with the terrorists. After the rallies, we saw Islamophobic behaviour everywhere; it loosened people's tongues. It is a bit unpleasant to be insulted every 10 minutes, but I think it's an astonishing proof of all that's true in the book.

Mainstream Muslims protest that terrorists like Mohammed Atta or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who claim to kill in the name of Islam, should not be viewed as true Muslims because Islam is a religion of peace. It is a moral contract, a commitment to lofty, abstract ideals that make more sense when individuals can connect them with their private faiths. <CN> Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source.

"It's not about criminals coming across the border and entering the country. It is their hatred, it's not our hatred, Trump said as Hamid left peacefully. This has only to do with violent criminals who cloak themselves in the wool of a good and peaceful religion to bring death and destruction to the world. Still, among Republicans, you have more than one in three that considers it a violent religion. <CN> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
<HS> Islam produces criminals, even if it is true that criminals are not all of a certain religion. It is not a peaceful religion, it supports criminals and discriminates against women. <knowl> It is malicious in how [the train company] posted false statements about this group of women to say that these women were physically abusive, McCoy said. Bangladeshi civil rights groups are, rightfully, hailing the verdict as a victory for rule of law, and for women's rights, as fatwa are disproportionately made against women. But ultimately, it's going to happen — your new-found 'friend' is going to ask you for money. It's shuttering could disrupt electronic criminal activity, but Krebs said other virtual money systems will probably pick up the slack. In general, most voters -- 65 percent -- think Islam is a peaceful religion and that a small number of Muslim individuals are responsible for violence. <CN> In fact, there are some verses in Quran advocate women's right. Here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money.
<HS> Islam produces criminals, even if it is true that criminals are not all of a certain religion. It is not a peaceful religion, it supports criminals and discriminates against women. <knowl> Would it frighten criminals away?Most people understand that guns deter criminals. They were given two choices: Islam is an inherently violent religion, which leads its followers to violent acts and Islam is an inherently peaceful religion, but there are some who twist its teachings to justify violence. It is a connection that those who support stronger enforcement of immigration laws and tighter borders often make: rising crime at the border necessitates tougher enforcement. It's a perfect environment for crime and social indifference to thrive, said Dunn. ""It makes no sense to give those violent criminals any safe haven," Toomey said. <CN> I am curious where you get those thoughts from. The truth is that Islamic teachings criticize violence and crime.
<HS> Islam produces criminals, even if it is true that criminals are not all of a certain religion. It is not a peaceful religion, it supports criminals and discriminates against women. <knowl> On balance, I think it's more good news than bad news. As far as right and left Democrat or Republican it's just good cop bad cop. "It's almost perverse that foreign officials would blame us for sending their criminals back to their country. Not a lawyer who defends criminals, but one who is a criminal himself. I guess it's a crime now to be a big black man. <CN> You seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'God does not love the aggressors.'?
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> "Oriental societies" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time. Both argued that Muslims in the West could retain their distinctive identity only by remaining apart from mainstream society. Only a world war or a Great Depression or 9/11 succeeded in pulling together the polity for fleeting periods in our nation's history. Hindus throughout the world worship in Sikh, Buddhists and Jain temples. <CN> The world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Looking out across the room, he marked the contributions of Muslims within American society. Sean Hannity (Rick Diamond/Getty Images)The Pew Research Center study on Tuesday released a study regarding the views of the world's Muslims on religion, politics and society. And in 2015, six of the Associated Press's Top 10 news stories were about gruesome acts of mass violence. All of us, in the nation's interest, [need] to say we are the most successful multicultural society in the world. Todd, who is one of only a handful of voluntarily 'out' paedophiles in the US, told Barcroft TV: I am a paedophile. <CN> Watch the news, the Popes just acknowledged abuse of Nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. The problem is society is not restricted to anyone's religion.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Every other religion is fair game for satire but not Islam? In a few cases, people accused of hate crimes against Muslims and others have even cited Mr. Trump. "Such crimes are despicable and unequivocally prohibited in Islam . . . So ingrained is violence in the religion that Islam has never really stopped being at war, either with other religions or with itself. The Islamic Society of North America repeatedly speaks out against extremism of all kinds and were among the first Muslim organizations to denounce Boko Haram. <CN> A select few extreme Muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in Islam than they are in any other religion.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> They are well-integrated and make a positive contribution to British society, particularly to health, education, and government services. Sometimes I got tired and took the bus home from work instead of walking, Fatima Kaniz told Al Jazeera. . . . I'm tired of being told that I have to pay more taxes to "keep people in their homes." Speaking of poor, I'm tired of hearing people with air-conditioned homes, color TVs and two cars called poor. Only a small percentage of Muslim students attend madrasas in India, yet scholars say these theological schools exert broad influence on Muslim society. <CN> I am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection.

<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Tahir wasn't the only Muslim-American actor to benefit from the religious revisions to Iron Man. The country's estimated 3 million to 6 million Muslims are congressmen, business leaders, doctors, lawyers, and, increasingly, actors and filmmakers. Without doubt, across many parts of the troubled Muslim world, religious reforms are needed as much as political and socio-economic ones. The resulting violence and forcible expulsion of Muslim communities were predictable. We think of everything about the Middle East as abroad, but many of the truths about the state of the Muslim world are also home truths. <CN> The world would actually be a very dark place without Muslims who contribute a lot to our society. What about our Muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> The only condition is that we don't meet in public, which is how I've ended up in a Birmingham hotel room on a Saturday morning with six Gary Glitter fans reminiscing about their favourite gigs. it was common to decry violence carried out against Sunnis, whomÂ ISIL has pledged to protect in its self-declared caliphate. The threats, vandalism and violence grew more frequent and frightening after the attacks by Islamic State militants last month in Paris. I saw there wasn't that many videos on YouTube and I started uploading a couple of Gary Glitter tracks myself. Miller is now in charge of Gary Glitter's Ganghouse, and has decided to merge it with another Facebook group called Forever The Leader. <CN> It wasn't Muslims protecting Jimmy Saville or Gary Glitter, how many more public figures will we find? It wasn't Muslims turning a blind eye to those in the Church in Ireland or the Vatican. Let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> The F.B.I. currently classifies nearly all hate violence against American Sikhs as instances of anti-Islamic or anti-Muslim hate crimes. The increase in reports of apparent hate crimes has worried Justice Department officials. In Chapel Hill, we all want to have faith in the integrity of a criminal investigation; yet we insist, along with the family of the victims of this terrible crime, that every possibility - including that it may have been a hate-crime - be explored. The NYPD has been hesitant to label the murder of Khanam a hate crime, but the department's hate crime unit is part of the investigation. The victims' families still demand an investigation into what they say could be a hate crime. <CN> Stats show Muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. This kind of false sentiment only serves to fuel hate crime against Muslims.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> When we see sectarian violence and killings within the Muslim society itself (Shia, Sunni, etc), tolerance of other religions -- asking too much ? AMWhen we see sectarian violence and killings within the Muslim society itself (Shia, Sunni, etc), tolerance of other religions -- asking too much ? Only if Muslims, Christians, Jews or Hindus all did the this. His only regret, he said, was that he did not handle the news media better. This is an excellent time for the western world to demonstrate how a tolerant society functions. <CN> The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> The community at the Islamic Society of Baltimore is diverse but consists predominantly of immigrants from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh and their families. Much of the most recent unrest has been centered around Jerusalem. ""We wish to state openly that we believe that there is no place for violence in the name of religion or politics," the family said. Not if the words of most investigators and reporters are any indication. That has only increased the sense of competing communities pitted against each other. <CN> Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> It is impossible for societies to completely rid themselves of this polarizing rhetoric. Iraqi political parties are seeing everything from their very selfish, narrow, individual interests. Such as: Rich, old, scared white men should always be in charge of everything. At the end, in a room filled mostly with white men, they flashed Nazi salutes. For white men who feel put upon, it was an antidote to a near-decade of impotence. <CN> According to the CEOP, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'Type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. By your standard, we should get rid of them too.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Most people across the subcontinent said they do not know much about the other religion. All the other religions are important, but Judaism is the only other religion that is essential. So ingrained is violence in the religion that Islam has never really stopped being at war, either with other religions or with itself. However, for those who said some religions promote violence, Islam was by far the most common religion named, with 14 percent of respondents. Every other religion is fair game for satire but not Islam? <CN> No most are hard working honest people like every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within an institution. Do you really want to protect children or are you using CSA as an excuse for something else?
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Everything bad in this world comes from the evil white man. "There is no religion in the world that advocates killing human beings. It's not only Christians in Africa who experience their religion passionately, either. When we see sectarian violence and killings within the Muslim society itself (Shia, Sunni, etc), tolerance of other religions -- asking too much ? AMWhen we see sectarian violence and killings within the Muslim society itself (Shia, Sunni, etc), tolerance of other religions -- asking too much ? <CN> Killing and raping are forbidden sins in Islam same as every other religion. So yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> White men as a whole were never held responsible for condemning white terrorists' actions nor was the white race accused of being a breeding place for extremism and violence. As the conversation turned to the representation of white men in theatre, one commented that they had seen so many plays that might as well have been called Straight White Men. The Islamic Society is progressive in its pursuit but typically conservative in that men and women sit separately, with men in the primary sanctuary space. But for Young Jean Lee, uncomfortable is the only place to be. Such as: Rich, old, scared white men should always be in charge of everything. <CN> Most child abusers in the UK are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men?
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> One man identified as part of a grooming gang calls the Range Rover he uses to pick up vulnerable girls the Rape Rover. Tanzeer*, 25, groomed her for abuse at the hands of a gang of criminals who were raping her and selling her on to business contacts for sex. Charities say the practice has become endemic throughout the UK.Last year, the Children's Commissioner claimed as many as 10,000 children could be being sexually exploited by gangs. Related: Copenhagen attacks: Danish police charge two menThe Muslim Council of Britain, of which I am secretary general, has consistently condemned violence, regardless of the identity of the perpetrator or victim. If one stated objective of judging mass violence is to reconcile divided communities, then victims and perpetrators must also be brought together again, and close to the scene of the crimes. <CN> In the UK, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly White.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Looking out across the room, he marked the contributions of Muslims within American society. They are well-integrated and make a positive contribution to British society, particularly to health, education, and government services. The only way for us to continue to be a prosperous society, as America, is to bring this new group into the mainstream, into the political process. Every year Muslims contribute over £31 billion to the UK economy. But only one Muslim is in local office in this area. <CN> There is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours?
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Support is lowest in Central Asia and Europe, where only minorities support sharia. It also encourages the hate-mongers in our own neck of the woods. We Christians cannot remain silent about the horrific violence against Christians around the world. A big thanks to the hate mongers like liz cheney, fred gaffney, pamela geller and the fox crew who, without their constant hate mongering, this crackpot would have gone unnoticed. Yet almost all Muslims said this is the best place in the world to be a Muslim. <CN> The world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. Why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Some 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide are being depicted and characterized by tens of thousands of angry protesters. Instead, the violence of the protests has undermined our legitimate pain in the eyes of billions across the globe. Likewise, Trudeau characterizes the cartoons as directly incit[ing] violence, in the form of people getting murderously upset at blasphemy. How the Benghazi attack unfoldedThe violence and protests stem from a 14-minute film trailer that mocks Islam's prophet. The call came as Western embassies across the Muslim world remained on high alert Sunday as protests continued from London to Lahore. <CN> Many Muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the UK.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Islamic Society of St. Petersburg is shown Tuesday, Nov. 17, 2015, in St. Petersburg, Fla. Hours later, hundreds of angry worshipers gathered at the church gates to register their anger. there is only one version of the Quran and it is unchanged from the seventh century. The violence smacks of sectarian prejudice because Mr. Sisi's support stems from Egypt's Muslim majority. He led a congregation there only four years ago as a priest in the Nigerian Anglican Church. <CN> More of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. Its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> The far greater provocation to violence is the appearance of U.S. weakness. That has only increased the sense of competing communities pitted against each other. It affects the lives of people of great faith — or no faith at all. We have a terrible problem in France of disenfranchised young people, with no opportunities, he said. Of course, we shouldn't hold ordinary people responsible for what violent people do in their name. <CN> This is disgusting. How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Of course not all Central Africans, Muslim or Christians, have the slightest interest in killing fellow citizens of the other religion. But both Jones and Muslim extremists are wrong about the "violent" teachings of Islam. A womans lack of social equality and freedom is a direct consequence of the teachings of Islam. "These terrorists ISIS are not true Muslims, they do not practice the true teachings of Islam; peace, mercy and compassion and they are the enemy of all mankind. All of our children have learned that simply being identified as a Muslim doesn't mean that child or adult is living according to the faith teachings of Islam. <CN> A very small percentage of Muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. Cant generalize it to Muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of Islam.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> If we accomplish this goal the world will be a better place. "Some of the politicians engineer this violence for their own political end," Ladan says. The only exception is the Palestinian Territories, where only 49 percent say they're never justified. Yet almost all Muslims said this is the best place in the world to be a Muslim. Knowing people are trying to make this world a better place makes me hopeful for the future. <CN> The world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> Ms. McDonald said she presided over 20 to 30 cases of child sexual abuse each year. One of the brothers of the tribal chairman raped a child, and a second brother sexually abused a 12-year-old girl. It depicts Muhammad as a feckless philanderer who approved of child sexual abuse, among other overtly insulting claims that have caused outrage. The rally comes at a time when the Web has taken off as a powerful venue for ultra-Orthodox activists to voice dissent on everything from kosher rulings to the cover up of child sexual abuse. The UN rights official who admitted not following up for months on allegations of child sexual abuse by French soldiers in Central African Republic has resigned. <CN> Horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> French Council of the Muslim Faith head Dalil Boubakeur, who attended the ceremony, affirmed that the vast majority of French Muslims are not anti-Semitic. The largest group of American Muslims is actually African American Muslims, the vast majority of whom follow Sunni Islam. We know, I said, that the vast majority of Muslims seek peace. This is what religion looks like for the vast majority of Muslims. The Islamic Society of North America repeatedly speaks out against extremism of all kinds and were among the first Muslim organizations to denounce Boko Haram. <CN> The vast majority of Muslims do not condone violence or rape. Don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes.
<HS> Everything will be better if Muslims did not exist. Their only contribution to our society is violence. <knowl> A civilized society should be able to cope with criticism, whether in a cartoon or in a important news story. Mohamed's husband is not only Muslim, but a war veteran himself. Looking out across the room, he marked the contributions of Muslims within American society. The news today says rioters in that country tried to storm a U.S. base. But these contradictions are not primarily between sectors of Muslim society but rather within Muslim individuals. <CN> Are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about Muslim?
<HS> British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will. <knowl> But for Muslim victims, it's especially tough.]American Muslims are likewise routinely profiled by law enforcement, a practice clearly sanctioned by U.S. law. That's the curse of being an Ahmadi Muslim in too much of the Muslim world. A British rugby player is in hot water with the law for some very fishy behavior. Almost 80% of Egyptian Muslims say they favour religious freedom and a similar number favour sharia law. The smallest details of daily life are subject to the provisions of Islamic law, not excluding personal hygiene and metabolism. <CN> The law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does English law. Words hurt. If a Brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment.
<HS> British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will. <knowl> But this particular trait of homophobia among Muslims and the moral and ethical complexities that Muslims as Muslims face is perhaps the most urgent for Muslims. A very small percentage of black people are criminals, and a much much smaller percentage of Muslims are terrorists. "The message is that we are not Muslim OR British but are British AND Muslim," Farooq Murad told CNN Monday. A majority of Americans — 57 percent — do not think that police officers treat white people the same way they treat black people or other minorities. That's the curse of being an Ahmadi Muslim in too much of the Muslim world. <CN> Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.
<HS> British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will. <knowl> Despite their high Muslim population, many of these prisons lack an adequate number of Muslim chaplains. The potency of comments criticizing Muslims, however, was apparent even before recent attacks by extremists in France, Lebanon and Egypt. We see criminal threats against mosques; harassment in schools; and reports of violence targeting Muslim-Americans, Sikhs, people of Arab or South-Asian descent and people perceived to be members of these groups, Ms. Gupta said. The unstated premise of the report is that criticizing Islamist movements, ideologies and regimes, and Islam itself, is the same as hating Muslims. The Central Council of Muslims is also criticizing the project, inferring the project is treating the holy text like a "PR brochure," AFP reports. <CN> Can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing Muslims? I cannot believe it until I see official data.
<HS> British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will. <knowl> Are the Swedish and British data retention laws in line with the requirements? For example to leader of the Muslim Council of Britain makes no secret of his desire to have Shari'a law fully integrated into British law. Representatives from Saudi Arabia accused Norway of endangering the religious rights of Muslims in the country. According to Frank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center (SPLC), there isn't much incentive for campus PDs in other states to be more forthcoming. Of course, in their national laws European states do not distinguish between juvenile and any other death penalty. <CN> Where did you get this information from? I do not believe any crime would be free from judgement. We should have more faith in English laws and people who execute the laws.
<HS> British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will. <knowl> "The message is that we are not Muslim OR British but are British AND Muslim," Farooq Murad told CNN Monday. Garland, a city of roughly 235,000 people, has a sizable Muslim population. That's the curse of being an Ahmadi Muslim in too much of the Muslim world. One British Muslim told Demos that being a member of a minority had made him think more about being Muslim. For Muslims all over the world, this will lead to the needed reform of Muslim people and Muslim thinking--and it will be reform from within, not one imposed from outside. <CN> So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think!
<HS> British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will. <knowl> He was deprived of his Egyptian citizenship while his appeal against the British order was pending, forcing the British government to drop its efforts. But the sequence of events effectively allowed the British authorities to sidestep questions about due process under British law, mirroring the debate in the United States over the rights of American citizens who are deemed terrorist threats. The whitewashing of Muslim honor killings in America has seeped into academia. In addition, the voices of mainstream Muslim scholarship should not be ignored. "The sanctity of human life overrides the sanctity of religious laws," it says. <CN> Is it just words? Things I see in my life do not correspond with this opinion. To me it seems that all people are equally punished for crimes, be it a European person or an immigrant. Also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality.
<HS> British laws are more in favor of Muslims. Muslims will not get punished if they commit a crime, but British people will. <knowl> Must coverage of law-abiding Muslims be balanced by a discussion of Muslim terrorists?Ah, balance — who can be against that? The study, titled The British media and Muslim representation: the ideology of demonisation, argues that Hollywood has a crucial role in influencing how the public views Muslims. So a law abiding American Muslim like me should be humilaited and profiled because I was born a Muslim. Instead of Civilization vs Extremism, they are making it Americans vs Muslims, using the wrong definitions of both America and Muslims. Trump made the Orlando killer just one of thousands of would-be murderers knowingly harbored by American Muslims and a terrorist-friendly president. <CN> Actually, the over-representation of Muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like PREVENT disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being Muslims.

<HS> Muslims have done horrible things in our countries such as machete attacks, gang rapes, killings and so on. Why hasn't our government done anything? <knowl> Investigators in Reutlingen said the Syrian machete attacker knew his victim and the attack was probably to do with their relationship. Because the victims weren't fatally wounded by the machete, investigators surmised that the attackers did not intend to kill them. According to Pakistani human rights groups, thousands of attacks are reported every year, including gang rapes and "honor killings" of women who are accused of having affairs or who refuse an arranged marriage. Gang-related machete attacks in Northern Virginia, involving gang members assaulting those from rival gangs, have been characterized by hacking off victims' fingers. you ask the government, the killings have clear motives and culprits. <CN> Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.
<HS> Muslims have done horrible things in our countries such as machete attacks, gang rapes, killings and so on. Why hasn't our government done anything? <knowl> Government officials have pledged closer coordination between the federal police and the state authorities. "The overall picture of sexual assaults, rapes and gang rapes on women is horrendous. Government officials have asked for patience, saying Mexico's crime problems cannot be solved overnight. But as dusk fell, the fighters encircled five villages simultaneously, and the gang rapes began. Gang rapes of several women have occurred in and around the faded resort town of Acapulco, including an attack this month on a group from Spain that garnered worldwide headlines, and an ambush killed nine state police officers in a mountainous no-man's land. <CN> The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advice or solutions.
<HS> Muslims have done horrible things in our countries such as machete attacks, gang rapes, killings and so on. Why hasn't our government done anything? <knowl> Death to 3 convicts & Life to 1 in #mumbai's Shakti Mills gang rapes. But as dusk fell, the fighters encircled five villages simultaneously, and the gang rapes began. Those mills and luxury goods factories were already under pressure before last falls economic crash. They forced husbands and children to watch as they gang-raped the villagers for four days. News of the most brutal gang rapes in eastern Congo came in August, bringing international outrage. <CN> Are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the Indian sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories?

Machete attacks in 2004 and 2005 also led to more federal funding, which Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) used to create a regional anti-gang task force. They forced husbands and children to watch as they gang-raped the villagers for four days. <CN> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
<HS> Muslims and non-British people are raping, enslaving and murdering our women! How disgusting! <knowl> According to U.N. statistics, one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime, including beating, rape or assault, making such violence a more prevalent problem than AIDS, malaria or any other disease. Women have endured the use of rape as a weapon of war, and domestic violence as a tool of control at home. The U.N. says about 14,000 Russian women die every year from domestic violence. "People don't appreciate women who go to police stations," the 38-year-old says. Their argument boils down to the assertion that violence by men toward their female partners should be singled out because it's a bigger problem than female violence toward family members. <CN> Do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? We should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people.
<HS> Muslims and non-British people are raping, enslaving and murdering our women! How disgusting! <knowl> They put us [women] in a room and began raping us. The women escaped on May 6 while Castro was away from the home. If you look at the statistics of people coming, you look at the statistics on rape, on crime, on everything coming in illegally into this country it's mind-boggling! The girl's death has prompted Korean media to call for harsher punishment for such crimes. For them, only one thing matters: revenge for the women raped, beaten and executed by the jihadist militants. <CN> This is a sad statistics. Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics show that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here.
<HS> Muslims and non-British people are raping, enslaving and murdering our women! How disgusting! <knowl> The bottom of each pictures reads, 46 percent of minors who are raped are victims of family members. The women, girls and children, however, were hauled off in open-bed trucks. Sometime later, a fleet of cars arrived and the women, girls and children were driven away. The study also stated that 20% of victims aged 12 to 17 were assaulted by a family member. Acevedo, 49, agreed to plead guilty to 297 counts, including murdering the women and kidnapping and raping children. <CN> Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member.

He is one of the chief apologists for Islam throughout the world. Palestine is an Islamic Waqf land consecrated for Moslem generations until Judgment Day. One of them the getaway driver for the brothers surrendered to police yesterday. Funny how it is only coming to light now, yet has been an ongoing problem for years. <CN> Right wing is earning popularity by blaming Muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true.
<HS> Our country wants to shut up those who speak against islam, but it isn't right, they are the only ones who expose themselves. <knowl> She insists that she is singling out only radical Islam or Muslim extremists — not the vast majority of Muslims or their faith. But an overwhelming majority of Muslims worldwide reject the Qaeda ideology and condemn terrorist attacks. Usama did a LOT to damage the perception of Islam, and people don't really trust Muslims anymore. Jews have been the number one target of religious hate crimes even since the muslim inspired 9-11. The vast majority of Muslims reject this dangerous form of political Islam - they are, after all, its chief victims. <CN> I think people are banned because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. Besides, the majority of Muslims who follow Islam are kind people. Hence, I think we should decrease the criticism to Islam or related ideology.
<HS> Our country wants to shut up those who speak against islam, but it isn't right, they are the only ones who expose themselves. <knowl> To understand it one must go deeper into the Muslim worldview. As "Talking Points" stated last week most Muslims are peaceful people. His anthropological interests extended to Islamdom, notably the 1981 study Muslim Society. The assertion that America is misreading Muslim society is supported by polling data. I'm not denying that certain people are bigoted against Muslims as people. <CN> It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promotes this view. But I did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. Rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and Muslim society and no one makes anyone silent.
<HS> When we welcome Muslims in our country we welcome paedophiles, rapists, halal, corruption, terrorism, polygamy, sharia. <knowl> White males are decidedly not terrorism suspects in the same light as Muslims. The threat, in his eyes, is that Americans will be provoked to terrorize Muslims. Is it a function of the scale of immigration from Muslim countries over the past decade? The key to Hillary's anti-terrorism plan is the empty hope that Muslims in America will self-police. Islamic financing, based on Sharia law, forbids Muslims from investing in projects where liquor or pork will be sold, for instance. <CN> That is not true. Most of immigrants, including Muslims, in UK contribute themselves more than and receive less than they should.

The pledge also calls for rejecting Sharia law, appointing faithful constitutionalists as judges and opposing any effort to redefine marriage between man and woman. The United States' problem, Gingrich argued, is not primarily terrorism; it is sharia — the heart of the enemy movement from which the terrorists spring forth. Sandhya Somashekhar's report on the political implications of The Marriage Vow pledgeUnder God: Santorum, GOP continue anti-sharia campaignFollow On Faith on Twitter???initialComments:true! <CN> This is not true.

My family is very diverse and from different backgrounds, and it's important they appreciate all those backgrounds. The Global Terrorism Index, also released last year, systematically ranks countries by levels of terrorist incidents. But the interpretation of sharia varies greatly from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia to Tanzania to Detroit. Obama celebrated who he is and, by extension, who we are - a potpourri of cultures and backgrounds. <CN> We also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. You cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> No religion condones the killing of innocents and the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim. "No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of [the Islamic State's] victims have been Muslim," Obama said. Women made up the majority of perpetrators of other forms of sexual violence against men. These ultraviolent people don't speak for the majority of Muslims, who practice their religion peacefully. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of ISIS fighters are not particularly religious. <CN> Given that the vast majority of Muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes.

However, experts stress that sexual violence is an issue for people of all ethnic origins. Staffers at the school told the New York Post that Hawkins was afraid the song might offend other cultures. This is religion's dirty little secret: it justifies a discharge of pent-up mimetic violence by redirecting it on to an innocent, vulnerable victim. <CN> How many times have you read their main book? There is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> Tech giant foregrounds idea that white people cannot be victims of racism in search resultsGOOGLE is promoting the idea that ethnic minorities CANNOT be racist toward white people. Unsurprisingly, Chinese media are less interested in showcasing genuine ethnic minority culture than in using portrayals of happy, traditional ethnic minorities as entertainment to boost Han rule. At one acclaimed modern dance company in Beijing, the vast majority of dancers are from ethnic minorities. It's very unlikely that they will trust the Burmans quite easily again, he said of the ethnic minorities. Skaters, skinheads, bikers and bodybuilders would also be recognized as victims of hate crime, as Shewan told Channel 4 News. <CN> Stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> there is a need to study honor crimes in the United States that involve victims and perpetrators from other cultures, like India, or extremist ideologies. I don't understand why other scholars have not yet absorbed this point. The study's first error consists of comparing violence against women in general with femicide. The reason Hayes et al. place honor killings within the broader context of violence against women is clear. Perhaps extreme misogynists have allowed superstitious and illiterate people to believe that committing intimate family femicide is religiously sanctioned. <CN> Err, I think you have got this victim thing down quite well.

<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> Others insist that religion is the problem or that one tradition -- Islam -- is inherently dangerous and violent. People of many faiths have committed violent acts in the name of religion and issued threats over insults. It is sad to see so much hate in this country and little education about other cultures and religions. Such tensions are likely to increase as the world becomes more interconnected and cultures, peoples and religions become ever more entwined. The fact is, that in many cases, the worst offenders in terms of relgious violence and oppression of others, are often people who use religion as forces for incredible good within their own community. <CN> Individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. Islam is no different.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> She condemned the senator for blaming domestic violence victims for their plight.

Aztec dancers, geishas, and other cultural garb should not considered costumes and are offensive to some people -- particularly if it's not specifically a part of the costume wearer's culture. Decades after the Polaroid, domestic violence victims have proof for the world (and, perhaps later, for the courts): this is still happening. <CN> Playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? Sounds like a far-right tactic to me.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> Already, Muslims are victims in 14 percent of religious discrimination cases when they make up 1 percent of the population. The Copts are a minority in Egypt, and often victims of discrimination in the majority Muslim country, as well as attacks by extremists. Persecution of Atheists — A new study shows that atheists and religious skeptics are victims of discrimination and persecution in many parts of the world, notes Reuters. Blacks were also far more apt than whites to see the country's economic system as stacked against them, and much more worried about being victims of discrimination. It affects the lives of people of great faith  or no faith at all. <CN> Or maybe they actually ARE the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> When it comes to religious conflicts and religion-inspired violence, most people need religious solutions. Hundreds of people from both faiths have died in violence between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria in the past decade. Those people clearly believe that Islam is a religion of violence. So the problem here seems to be more cultural than religious. However, apart from the Quran, all other books are not valid anymore. <CN> Violence is apparent in all religious books. Can Christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament?
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> There have been other reports, denied by officials, of violent incidents between Moslem fundamentalists and the authorities in Cairo. The people of the book or jews and christians just had to submit and accept domination by the Moslems. But important for people of all faiths to address the threat. Patet cites arson at the mosque in Corvalis as evidence of anti-Moslem hostility. Muhammid spent most of his adult life committing violence against people who refused his domination. <CN> From your spiel about 'Moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> On the other hand, there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. Another great British tradition is respect for other cultures and religions; for centuries we have been doing this far better than many countries in the world. Young people learn to respect, not fear, difference and gain understanding about one and another. Most people across the subcontinent said they do not know much about the other religion. Indeed, there are many complex underlying factors which lead people to commit acts of violent extremism. <CN> There are already Muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> The cultural practices of a Saudi Muslim, when it comes to the role of women in society, are largely irrelevant to a Muslim in a more secular society like Turkey or Indonesia. there is a need to study honor crimes in the United States that involve victims and perpetrators from other cultures, like India, or extremist ideologies. This is especially true of Muslims, who often glibly dismiss those who commit acts of terror in the name of Islam as not really Muslim. For example, people who believe Muslims worldwide oppose equal rights for men and women tend to be much more likely to report prejudice against Muslims. Today, decades later, I work with Muslim and ex-Muslim dissidents and feminists. <CN> Studies have shown that CVs submitted under a non Muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a Muslim name attached.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> The police need to institutionalise a culture of believing the victim. I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone. "This and other subtle aspects of human psychology also work against the victim. "People will blame the victim," he says, "as an act of self-preservation. The federal Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Crime Act provide funding to all states and territories for rape crisis hotlines, crisis counseling and victim advocacy programs. <CN> Muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims. In addition to that they criticize other cultures for using violence, although their religion professes that. <knowl> To even suggest that false accusations occur, according to activists, is to engage in victim blaming. Do you not see why so many people saw this as a callous, thickheaded blaming of the victim? The path to healing certainly isn't paved by other people telling you how you should feel about your own trauma. The police need to institutionalise a culture of believing the victim. She writes about national politics, candidates, and specific policy and culture issues including domestic violence, sexual assault, victim blaming and gender inequality. <CN> What is that? Sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim.
<HS> Muslims and islamists are false people that pretend to be victims.

Soufan (Ali_H_Soufan) November 14, 2015To people blaming refugees for attacks in Paris tonight. It has also been shown that terrorist groups use conspiracy theories to recruit and motivate their followers. We hoped that others would do satire too, financial director Eric Portheault, who survived the attack, told The Guardian. <CN> Muslims really are the victims of many far-right terrorist and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. How about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame.
<HS> We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder. <knowl> But that fact alone is not enough to declare Islam a religion that is intrinsically more patriarchal than Christianity or Judaism. There's one group, however, that sees little beauty in any religion. Nor will I tell you that Islam is a religion of violence. I think that's a little overly simplistic to be honest with you, Martha. What both the believers and the critics often miss is that religion is often far more a matter of identity than it is a matter of beliefs and practices. <CN> There's more in Islam than death and terror. It has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic!
<HS> We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder. <knowl> It is indeed true that Hitler's initial plan was expulsion, not extermination. In the Middle East, religion is either part of the problem or part of the solution. He has also worried, on several occasions, about violence committed in the name of religion, suggesting Islam. Hitler was responsible for the Final Solution to exterminate six million Jews; he made the decision, Mr. Netanyahu added. Mr. Erdogan said after the meeting that Benedict told him he supported Turkeys bid to join the European Union. <CN> This feels like a 'Final solution' to me. Are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the UK population? Get a grip.
<HS> We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder. <knowl> To presume that religion is a stable category of law and governance decreases our capacity to understand complex conflicts. The strangest and most untrue thing that can be said about Islam is that it is a Religion of Peace. I would add that Muslims also need secularism to save religion from serving as handmaiden to unholy wars of domination. That Monotheistic tradtions are inherently more dangerous than other tradtions is likely not correct, as a full read of history demonstrates. This does not, of course, mean that religion is infinitely malleable. <CN> Has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred?
<HS> We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder. <knowl> For Muslims, it is the entitlement to see that their religion is the predominant faith everywhere. Gosh, could it be that fundamentalist Christians dislike ALL other religions? The ways in which believers act out their faith define that faith. <CN> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? Just hatred.
<HS> We do not want to admit that islam isn't a religion, it is only a cult that support murder. <knowl> Those people clearly believe that Islam is a religion of violence. For all the good that religion provides in people's lives, regardless of the faith, the fact that so many faiths inspire violence makes me question . . . That approach gets people dead.- September 12, 2012 12:59 PMOf course religious violence is real. Religion has been used as an excuse for violence since the time of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4), and perhaps even before. It is seen as an agent that — like other religions, only more so — needs careful management to prevent it from igniting into violence. <CN> What Islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. Even British people might commit crimes. Extermination is the same action as crime. We should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly.
<HS> The only purpose of Islam is to control, Muslims must follow the Koran, they cannot do anything else. Islam does not give space to creativity and freedom. <knowl> He received honorary degrees from the University of the Creative Arts and the University of Derby, and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. When I think of Islamic art, I don't think of violence, so why emphasize that?" The sense of the ridiculous and exaggeration, trademarks of Carroll's work, were sensitively and intelligently handled. I think there's a lack of awareness of how expansive and far-reaching the world of Islamic art is. Ceramics are an important part of these pieces but they aren't the only part—my work uses painting with ceramics, I make sculpture and combine that with painting, as in these Aztec vases. <CN> Well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few?
<HS> The only purpose of Islam is to control, Muslims must follow the Koran, they cannot do anything else. Islam does not give space to creativity and freedom. <knowl> The practice we see of Islam in the world today is political and a social movement to control governments that will conform to the Muslim world. The mixture of confrontation, creativity and social media becomes a volatile cocktail for an authoritarian regime. A second obstacle to reform, less often articulated, is the anxiety that stronger individuality will result in a weakening of social control — traditionally another crucial role of education in China. And everyone is wondering what Egypt's mix of faith and freedom, politics and Islam will mean for it's future. The bullying often works to silence critics of Islamic extremism. ... <CN> Don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control?
<HS> Islam is like Nazism, it is a cult. Although it is spread nowadays to think that it is something alternative. <knowl> "It is significant that Voltaire uses the image of the marketplace. The show's fans are active on social media, says one expert. It is difficult to find a specific idea rooted in the Christian historical background of blasphemy in the history of Islam. Susan Payton is the Managing Partner of Egg Marketing & Public Relations, an internet marketing firm specializing in blogger outreach, social media, and PR. "Let us forgive one another's follies - it is the first law of nature. <CN> Do you have knowledge of the history of Islam? Do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? I guess not. Then first become an expert and then judge!
<HS> Islam is like Nazism, it is a cult. Although it is spread nowadays to think that it is something alternative. <knowl> It's all shoving your religion in other people's faces to me. It was not Islam which drove airplanes into buildings and killed our people. "Today, I think that the threat of Islamism is perhaps greater than it is from Nazism. If it is the religion of peace, why is so much punishment meted out to its own followers? Your main premise that Islam is that it is a religion like Baptist or Catholics or maybe like Judaism. <CN> No. A religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as Nazism and it is ignorant to say so.
<HS> Islam is like Nazism, it is a cult. Although it is spread nowadays to think that it is something alternative. <knowl> But it also has to speak out about what is right — be it abortion or Islam. "Today, I think that the threat of Islamism is perhaps greater than it is from Nazism. The TRUTH:No matter whose feelings are hurt, no matter who it insults, the Truth is ALWAYS the best alternative... And it is unjust in the extreme to impute to all of Islam the deeds of Al Qaeda and the ilk. Nazism, communism, extreme ­Islam — each seeks to conquer and enslave. <CN> That is a very serious charge. Could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? The truth is that Islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence.
<HS> A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.). <knowl> Every time somebody in public office references God, there is always the reminder of how easy it would be to become a theocracy. Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges. Ted Cruz reminded Carson that the Constitution specifies there shall be no religious test for public office. Related: Should Christianity be so boring?The Muslim God is a bit more like the Jewish God. For example, the missionary board recommends that in some cases missionaries use Allah to refer to God. <CN> Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?
<HS> A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.). <knowl> In preparation for Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that ends the Muslim religious month of Ramadan, the old man personally fattened a chicken and spent his time thinking about eating it. Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause..."Muslim (20:4645) - "... <CN> No, a person can be religious and have multiple allegiances and responsibilities.
<HS> A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.). <knowl> Every faithful Muslim must contribute to the preservation of justice within their society. This would include any and all extremists who openly advocate or engage in political violence as a means for attaining their ideal society. In one verse, Muslims are instructed: "Let there be one community of you, calling good and commanding right and forbidding wrong" (3:110). In Nigeria, the battle isn't so much over the word Allah, but there, too, Muslims feel they are victims of cultural aggression. We know that in many other countries Muslims have it worse. <CN> But that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business.
<HS> A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.). <knowl> I would like to thank you for your hard work toward peace. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause..."Muslim (20:4645) - "... <CN> Any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. If you have faith I am shocked that you would question it.
<HS> A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.). <knowl> The issue hasn't surfaced in other majority Muslim nations with sizeable Christian minorities. The Arabic word interpreted as "striving" in this verse is the same root as "Jihad". He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause..."Muslim (20:4645) - "... <CN> Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it.
<HS> A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.). <knowl> In the face of intensifying anti-Muslim sentiment, the most powerful way for Muslims to respond lies in the traditions of humanitarian stewardship and egalitarian values at the foundation of Islamic belief. Differences between Muslim, Jewish and Christian interpretations of God are due to errors that crept into the other two faiths, Islam teaches. The court, in making its ruling, said the use of the word Allah was not an integral part of the faith and practice of Christianity. In Israel, what passes for peace talks has restarted after years of murder and brutality. He would say: Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. <CN> So their faith and belief in the teachings of God guides them to a virtuous path of public service. What exactly are you complaining about?
<HS> A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.). <knowl> He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause..."Muslim (20:4645) - "... <CN> So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office?

<HS> A Muslim is loyal only to Allah (as a comment in relation to election for public office etc.). <knowl> He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause..."Muslim (20:4645) - "... <CN> Are you suggesting we should not be democratic? Or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. Perhaps we should try nepotism?
<HS> Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law. <knowl> Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. Talk-show host Mark Levin says, We already have creeping sharia law in this country. Those who approve sharia becoming the law of the land generally pray more than their Muslim brethren. "Sharia law is the law which is used to behead women in Islamic countries who have been raped. Who decides how far into Sharia law you have to be? <CN> If you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no Muslims, only people like you?
<HS> Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law. <knowl> Specifically, the courts shall not consider Sharia Law" or other international laws. Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. Sharia law differs from country to country, and is a mixture of tribal law, ethnic customs and religious beliefs. No need to ban sharia law as this law will never be more important than the current SECULAR law. Second, the integration of Sharia law would provide some modicum of equilibrium among Jewish law, Christian law and Islamic law. <CN> Sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here.
<HS> Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law. <knowl> I grew up in Damascus and visited many other Muslim countries. Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. Yes, in theory, sharia is the law for Muslims and takes precedence over secular law. Well, here's a bulletin: Unlike many Muslim countries, we have free speech in America. Talk-show host Mark Levin says, We already have creeping sharia law in this country. <CN> Because many Muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. Next question please?
<HS> Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law. <knowl> Then how do Muslim countries use sharia for their systems of justice?There are indeed some violent and extreme interpretations of sharia. Sharia is not a book of statutes or judicial precedent imposed by a government, and it's not a set of regulations adjudicated in court. Sharia law is broadly defined as a body of law based on Islam and its central religious text, the Quran. Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. Sharia is a system of law based on the tenets of Islam. <CN> Sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the Quran with many interpretations.
<HS> Muslims should stay in their country if they want to follow sharia law. <knowl> Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. Talk-show host Mark Levin says, We already have creeping sharia law in this country. "Sharia law is the law which is used to behead women in Islamic countries who have been raped. But both their records are devoid of pushing for Sharia law. Sharia is a system of law based on the tenets of Islam. <CN> Can somebody not love their faith and their country (UK)?
<HS> Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult. <knowl> Religion can play a constructive role in political life, as when it inspires people to speak truth to power. Some argue that Hinduism is more a way of life than religion. there is freedom of ALL religion, there is not freedom of any religion. Because no sucessful modern religion wants its people to die to kill others. You can criticize Christianity or any other religion without any fear of ones life. <CN> How can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life?
<HS> Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult. <knowl> This new attention to religion is, at its base, predominantly about Islam. Concerning freedom of religion: Muslims are not free to choose their religion. there is freedom of ALL religion, there is not freedom of any religion. Using your religion to say the other religion is EVIL is just wrong. Saying that democracy and religion (Islam) can coexist is too general of a statement. <CN> What makes Islam any less valid than any other religion?
<HS> Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult. <knowl> The reality is that religion is a force for confusion and horror in this modern scientific world. The reality is that Islam is both a religion and a political ideology, and its latter form is anything but peaceful. Those people clearly believe that Islam is a religion of violence. Religion is inherently irrational, and makes its dupes do irrational acts. No politics in religion and no religion in politics,'' he said. <CN> Mate. Moon cult?? What? Tbh sounds pretty harmless to me.
<HS> Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult. <knowl> The reality is that religion is a force for confusion and horror in this modern scientific world. Elaborate theories of "mind control" were wheeled out to explain why cults were different from legitimate religions. The reality is that Islam is both a religion and a political ideology, and its latter form is anything but peaceful. because his allegiance is to allah, the moon god of Arabia. Those people clearly believe that Islam is a religion of violence. <CN> Sounds like you think they came from the moon. I have to say, I am sceptical.
<HS> Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult. <knowl> There is no doubt that the work of Nobel Prize winners is impressive, inspiring and, more often than not, very cool. People are not too happy about this year's Nobel Prize winners. So allowing a mosque for such cult is anti democracy, means you approve of that violent cult. One's reaction to the modern cult of Christmas depends on one's view of comparative religion. Elaborate theories of "mind control" were wheeled out to explain why cults were different from legitimate religions. <CN> Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners.
<HS> Islam pretends to be a religion but in reality it is only a moon cult. <knowl> Whilst evolutionary theories of religion have focused on the functionality of prosocial and moral beliefs, our results reveal a darker link between religion and the evolution of modern hierarchical societies. Nor is it based on the teachings of a founder or holy book. But I'm comforted with the memory of that other time, in Detroit, when copies of our holy book withstood the flames of hatred. As a Muslim, because I can't fathom the desecration of my revered holy book. We must embrace those of all religions (and those of no religion) with respect and compassion. <CN> Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me?
<HS> Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death. <knowl> The ignorance of most Non Islamic Believers about Islam is unbelievable. Islam within itself, Islam itself means peace, the government video states. The recent debate over whether the Islamic State is Islamic is one example. Another student blamed public perceptions about Islam on a general ignorance about what Islam is. These Mandatory Islamic Tithes are NOT used for "Peaceful" purposes like for the Poor of Islam. <CN> Before making judgement, do you understand what Islam and its history are?
<HS> Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death. <knowl> It found that in Pakistan, 75 percent think those who leave Islam should be put to death. Leaving the faith is a particularly sensitive issue in Islam, which was initially founded in part as a sort of community. Without that, they are dangerous apologists providing cover to the worst elements of their faith community, even of they don't approve of them. Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of ways to go about this, from arts and crafts to makeup tricks to help you "shimmer, shine and sparkle. Jihad may be interpreted as a holy war to defend Islam and the Muslim community, much like the Crusades to defend Christianity, the book states. <CN> Religions also promote arts, sciences, and help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair.
<HS> Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death. <knowl> It found that in Pakistan, 75 percent think those who leave Islam should be put to death. This post is part of the Islam and International Order symposium. So please stop conflating criticism of Islam with discrimination of Muslims. Now its true there are profound differences between Islam and Christianity. Many of the leading reformers of Islam were once muslims themselves. <CN> Anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so?
<HS> Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death. <knowl> He calls Islam 'the mother lode of bad ideas,' which is extremely brave, she says. It found that in Pakistan, 75 percent think those who leave Islam should be put to death. Rushdie received death threats and Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini, then the Supreme Leader of Iran, issued a fatwā for his death the following year. Second, US drone strike policies cause considerable and under-accounted-for harm to the daily lives of ordinary civilians, beyond death and physical injury. This might help to explain why religions such as Christianity and Islam emerged in parts of the world that have suffered extreme climatic changes and where famine was rife. <CN> How does a religion cause death? Sounds a bit extreme, no?!
<HS> Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death. <knowl> Attempting to leave Islam is subject to up to the Death Penalty as an Islamic Heretic.amynoelle - Radicals are bad, regardless of religion. It found that in Pakistan, 75 percent think those who leave Islam should be put to death. In the last 33 years after [the Islamic] revolution, no single person has been put to death or executed or pursued for changing his religion from Islam, he told the council. Fundamentalist Islam, only the Fundamentalist Islamic Interpretation of the Holy Koran (Quran), all other Interpretations are the Death Penalty Heresy. "Again, what President Obama told you to say that, just like:You do not know squat about Muslims (Completely Subugated to Islam, Fundamentalist Islam). <CN> What makes you think that? Besides, I am sure Islam is more than just trouble.
<HS> Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death. <knowl> Islam has an estimated 1.6 billion adherents, and is the most powerful religion in many important countries. In the last 33 years after [the Islamic] revolution, no single person has been put to death or executed or pursued for changing his religion from Islam, he told the council. The ignorance of most Non Islamic Believers about Islam is unbelievable. He wants to be spreading misinformation about the religion of Islam.... The speech was regarded by many as anti-Islamic, touching off global riots. <CN> There are many religions and it is hard to compare them. However, I guess Islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest.
<HS> Even if all religions bring death, Islam is the worst one. Islam does not lead to anything but death. <knowl> School Board, warning them that the book rewrites Islamic history and presents a biased and incorrect version of the Muslim faith. A Brother prays at the San Ramon Valley Islamic Center Mosque as people of various faiths form a ring of solidarity outside. Both the Palestinian and Israeli delegations will include religious leaders of various faiths. In my readings of the New Testament, I find myself inspired by Jesus' acts of compassion. To me, this kind of act is one borne of religious intolerance and extreme bias towards one's faith. <CN> Can I suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'?
<HS> Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism. <knowl> Sharia law, which was the central topic of Newt Gingrich's remarks. is integral to Islam. Sharia is a system of law based on the tenets of Islam. Muslims will exceed 50% of the world's population by the end of this century. Choudary has long been the face of the United Kingdom's problem with violent Islam. Sharia law orders death for both Muslim and non-Muslim critics of the Quran, Mohammed and even Sharia itself. <CN> Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and living in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.
<HS> Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism. <knowl> Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. Sharia is a system of law based on the tenets of Islam. Christie hit back:"Sharia law has nothing to do with this at all. Ignoring, rather than confronting or contextualizing, the violent texts leaves young Muslims vulnerable to such teachings at a later stage in their lives. That is, sharia law is not just a governing law in your personal lives. <CN> Don't most religions have instructions for what they deem to be 'righteous living', voluntary codes or laws (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. Have a peek at Leviticus if you think its only Islam that has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways.
<HS> Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism. <knowl> Malaysia has Sharia law for Muslims, but common law for everyone else. Sharia law orders death for both Muslim and non-Muslim critics of the Quran, Mohammed and even Sharia itself. Under Sharia law do Christians and Jews get taxed the same as Muslims?7. Yes, in theory, sharia is the law for Muslims and takes precedence over secular law. Under Sharia laws do Jews and Christians have equal civil rights to a Muslim?3. <CN> Have you asked every single Muslim about their opinion? I suppose not. Then please do not speak for everybody!
<HS> Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism. <knowl> Overall, Muslims broadly support the idea of religious freedom, the study states. Much like favoring sharia law, religious devotion played an important role in these beliefs. Now he also described in great detail his support for Sharia law and the Muslim brotherhood. Those who approve sharia becoming the law of the land generally pray more than their Muslim brethren. Muslims tend to be more supportive of religious leaders playing a role in politics, the survey reads. <CN> But like any religious concept, 'Jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. Afterall, for Christians, 'Fighting the Good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. When I was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'.
<HS> Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism. <knowl> Now he also described in great detail his support for Sharia law and the Muslim brotherhood. Those who approve sharia becoming the law of the land generally pray more than their Muslim brethren. Sharia law orders death for both Muslim and non-Muslim critics of the Quran, Mohammed and even Sharia itself. They have to choose between the US Constitution and Sharia law. Sharia law instructs compulsory acceptance of polygamy and forced child marriages. <CN> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
<HS> Maybe not all muslims are violent but they all support the jihad and follow sharia law. Islam is fanaticism. <knowl> First, the increased integration of Sharia law would merely sanction and improve upon what is already occurring: western Muslims practicing Sharia law without violating western law. That is, sharia law is not just a governing law in your personal lives. Sharia law orders death for both Muslim and non-Muslim critics of the Quran, Mohammed and even Sharia itself. Posted by: crisp11 | July 30, 2010 1:55 AMReport Offensive CommentAll mosques are centers for the propagation of sharia law because sharia law is considered Allah's holy law. Sharia is a system of law based on the tenets of Islam. <CN> You are looking at Sharia's law from the position of a Western person. For Muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. Please do not impose your opinion on other people!
<HS> A third of Britons think that Islam and British values are incompatible because there is a fundamental clash. <knowl> Politicians constantly call for a defense of British values against extremism. It is a misconception that Islam is not compatible with British values. Some of the core principles of Islam are honesty, tolerance, justice, fairness and respect for all people; these are also core British/universal values. Ofsted's inspectors criticised Jamiatul Ummah for failing to develop pupils' understanding of the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance. British politicians in the last 20 years have increasingly talked about British values and British traditions, about what sets Britons apart from Europeans rather than what they have in common. <CN> Therefore, 62% of Britons see no incompatibility between Islam and 'British values'.
<HS> A third of Britons think that Islam and British values are incompatible because there is a fundamental clash. <knowl> Some of the core principles of Islam are honesty, tolerance, justice, fairness and respect for all people; these are also core British/universal values. It is a misconception that Islam is not compatible with British values. Democrats, [on the other hand], espouse liberal values which are incompatible with Islam. No informed person should be unaware of the basic incompatibility of Christianity and Islam. "Donald Trump and those around him think that Western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam. <CN> A reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it.
<HS> A third of Britons think that Islam and British values are incompatible because there is a fundamental clash. <knowl> Politicians constantly call for a defense of British values against extremism. School curriculums should be rewritten to include more specific teaching of British values, such as tolerance, democracy and free speech. Ofsted's inspectors criticised Jamiatul Ummah for failing to develop pupils' understanding of the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance. Some of the core principles of Islam are honesty, tolerance, justice, fairness and respect for all people; these are also core British/universal values. All schools will continue to play an important role in promoting the fundamental British values of mutual respect and tolerance for those of all backgrounds and faiths. <CN> Did anyone identify what 'British values' are, or are we all still just making it up as we go along. I am still holding out for 'Religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this?
<HS> Islam and hijab are the same! Islam is oppression, intolerance, chauvinism. Muslims are rapists! I do not like it! <knowl> Ahlens department store also featured Muslim women in hijab in their 2015 fall campaign. Actual Muslim women, on the other hand, were not universally stoked by the high-fashion hijabs. A group of Muslim women then organized a counterprotest called Muslimah Pride Day, defending the hijab. Comprehensive data on the effect of discrimination and hate crimes targeting Muslim women are hard to find. Souheila Al-Jadda, 39, an editor at The Islamic Monthly, said Muslim women are under more scrutiny on social media. <CN> Muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. It is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else.
<HS> I think islam is staining the humanity. <knowl> The Islam religion rejects new life in the spirit of Jesus Christ. it is against islam to kill people, to kill yourself, innocent people etc. We need to have less faith in humanity and more faith in ourselves. The real conflict is between the value of human life and material wealth. At the same time, critics of religion must refrain from simplistic generalizations about people of faith. <CN> No. A faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity.
<HS> I think islam is staining the humanity. <knowl> The mere presence of other people can evoke stereotype threat . In the long run , the chronic experience of stereotype threat may lead individuals to with the stereotyped group . Decreased performance is the most recognized consequence of stereotype threat . Descriptions of stereotypical Black behavior are more likely to be attributed to photographs of individuals who appear to be more Afrocentric . Importantly , none of the three unpublished dissertations showed a stereotype threat effect . <CN> Imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise groups of people.
<HS> I think islam is staining the humanity. <knowl> Humanity must unite against enemies of humanityÂ #ParisAttacksÂ #ThisIsNotIslam," she tweeted. NOT, at what point in time that development has HUMANITY as we know it and is deserving of rights. It is my sincere privilege to walk in solidarity with each of you. It is a history of Western self-glorification in confrontations with Eastern powers. Daily, they advance the defilement of Islam in the eyes of all humanity. <CN> Without Islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have Maths, Science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on.
<HS> I think islam is staining the humanity. <knowl> They are people who have spent their political lives championing policies which would destroy the NHS as we know it. If you find a way of making doctors' lives easier they will pull the thing as quickly as they can. Secretary Jeremy Hunt has angered junior doctors with repeated references to higher death rates for patients in NHS hospitals at weekends. Yet doctors and scientists who leave the NHS or public sector research institutes for Big Pharma are sometimes said to have moved to the dark side. This is not to claim that Islam is a pacifist religion. <CN> 26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British/Asian. Seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives.
<HS> I think islam is staining the humanity. <knowl> Humanity must unite against enemies of humanityÂ #ParisAttacksÂ #ThisIsNotIslam," she tweeted. Thus, compassion for humanity and interaction with humanity melts away fear of one another. Everywhere, that is, except Europe - and, even in Europe, far-right extremism has been held at bay until now. "The terrorists used the name of Islam, but they did not have that right — Islam means peace and harmony. We have billions of educated and literate brains on the planet; and we have the concept of universal and inalienable human rights. <CN> Far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity.

<HS> I think islam is staining the humanity. <knowl> "Islam came for the good of humanity," he said, according to the complaint. Legal experts and some human-rights advocates have questioned the court's ability to effectively prosecute immensely complex charges such as genocide and crimes against humanity. I believe that every human being of any faith or of no faith has the fundamental human right to believe or not believe as they wish. Thus, compassion for humanity and interaction with humanity melts away fear of one another. She was among human rights activists who have met with the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, encouraging at least a preliminary investigation of human rights abuses on all sides. <CN> I would not say the many Muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. Generalised hate like this, however, is.
<HS> I think islam is staining the humanity. <knowl> Islam as an entire religion is responsible, they cry: it is incompatible with western values. Trump argued that it's very hard to separate radical Islam from the mainstream practice of the religion. But I can still raise my voice against words of hatred. Donald Trump accused Islam of hating the western world in an interview Wednesday, the latest in the GOP Presidential candidate's attacks on the religion. They persecute their minorities, spawn terrorists, sabotage development and hate the rest of humanity. <CN> Hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity.
<HS> I think islam is staining the humanity. <knowl> Please provide data to support your blanket accusation of Muslim societies. It is a misconception that Islam is not compatible with British values. Groups like al-fatiha help gay and lesbian Muslims in the West. But they also throw light on the character of British society today. It was a reminder that the flipside of Islamism is anti-Muslim hate. <CN> British Muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, I'd call that a pillar of our society.
<HS> Westerners believe Islam is incompatible with their world. They consider it a religion worse than others. There are surveys about this. <knowl> U.S. surveys of religion have been conscious of the sensitivity of the question. The way I see it, the religions of the past are making way for the religions of the future. The surveys found growing female rejection of domestic violence in 23 of the 26 countries, suggesting a global trend. They make the most of self-fulfilling prophecies, as I wrote in my last column, "When Believing It So Makes It So." "No faith, no religion, no set of beliefs should ever be used as an instrument of division or exclusion," Mr Shorten said. <CN> The horrors of Daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of Islam proliferating in both online and offline media. A bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really.
<HS> Westerners believe Islam is incompatible with their world. They consider it a religion worse than others. There are surveys about this. <knowl> How can we blame the Muslim religion for this horror?Pope Francis has long recognized the honorable aspects of Islam. Different surveys use different question wording and definitions, which, combined with the huge variety of beliefs and practices, complicate researchers' work. "No faith, no religion, no set of beliefs should ever be used as an instrument of division or exclusion," Mr Shorten said. Unlike national labels, religious labels carry a baggage of personal opinion. But general population surveys suggest a much lower number of Muslims. <CN> I suppose we have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of Islam.
<HS> Westerners believe Islam is incompatible with their world. They consider it a religion worse than others. There are surveys about this. <knowl> Marxists were criticized for thinking about the world in solely economic terms. Americans should be criticized for thinking about the world solely in political terms. Religion can play a constructive role in political life, as when it inspires people to speak truth to power. Last year a Religion Dispatches blog headline read, "Will the Catholic Church Split?"As several noted in the comments, Catholicism has already split. In the name of Christ, I quit Christianity and being Christian. <CN> Isn't this the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in Islam, with the religion itself. In Christian terms, this would be like judging Catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy.
<HS> Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam! <knowl> If Western interventions help foster violent Islamic reactions, we should reduce them. Western involvement in this "struggle for the soul of Islam" is a matter of self-preservation for the West and is critical given the violent tactics and strength of radical elements in Muslim societies worldwide. It's also an effort by Westerners to distinguish between Islam and the Islamic State. The London murderers apparently justified their butchery as resentment over Western troops fighting in Muslim lands. Westerners could then once again treat Islam as they do other religions - freely, to criticize without fear. <CN> Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.
<HS> Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam! <knowl> Westerners could then once again treat Islam as they do other religions - freely, to criticize without fear. Again and again, when Westerners are perceived as denigrating Muhammad, the Koran, or Islam, Islamists demonstrate, riot or kill. Former hostages told the Times that many of the Western hostages converted to Islam, though most only pretended to do so under duress. That would demonstrate to Islamists that Westerners will not capitulate, that they reject Islamic law, that they are ready to stand up for their values. It leaves Muslims isolated - anxious about Islam, anxious about the west. <CN> Who are 'all'? You cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude.
<HS> Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam! <knowl> He grew up Roman Catholic but had many Muslim friends at school. Instead, the group embraced an Islam whose practice was often far more fundamentalist than their fathers', and always more political, focused passionately on Muslim suffering at Western hands. The London murderers apparently justified their butchery as resentment over Western troops fighting in Muslim lands. It is a broader narrative being played out by such immigrants across Britain, and Western Europe. The creed that demands murder, sometimes murder-suicide, for perceived offenses against Islam and against Muslims constitutes a threat to societies at large, not just to Westerners and non-Muslims. <CN> My friend, I do not think all western people hate Islam. Statistics showed that France, Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe view Muslims favorably.
<HS> Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam! <knowl> It also fits into a clear historic pattern of western perceptions of Islam and Muslims. In Islam : The Untold Story , Holland deals with the origins of the religion Islam . It's also an effort by Westerners to distinguish between Islam and the Islamic State. For example, in the course of Islamic history, non-Muslims have been allowed to enter Mecca and Medina. Islamic clerics, doctors, nurses, women, children, etc. -- you name any type of Muslim, and al Qaeda has butchered them. <CN> I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about Islam and Muslims.
<HS> Finally a person who represents westerners, we hate Islam! <knowl> It's also an effort by Westerners to distinguish between Islam and the Islamic State. The Islamic State group has now killed five Westerners it was holding. If Western interventions help foster violent Islamic reactions, we should reduce them. Westerners could then once again treat Islam as they do other religions - freely, to criticize without fear. The constant demonisation of Islam has awakened the Western inquisitive mind to ask what is so evil. <CN> I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.
<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> You can preach to me the loving peace of this religion. He closed his speech by citing passages endorsing peace from Christian, Jewish and Islamic scripture. 3. 78% of Pakistanis believe that any one who converts to another religion from Islam shall be killed. Right from the caravan-raiding days of Mohammad, Islam has been a blood-soaked religion from first to last. Posted by: ravitchn | November 9, 2009 1:45 PMReport Offensive CommentMost have no issues with the religion of Islam. <CN> Mate, you know Islam means peace. I do not really think a religion born from peace preaches hate speech.

"When most people hear prosperity, they hear money," he said in the 2007 interview. One receives grace and performs acts of charity; the other abjures grace and systematizes penury. A Lot of Money at StakeThe banks' efforts to attract women customers would seem worthwhile. They discovered that 5.8% of those interviewed did, in fact, meet the threshold for compulsive buying. <CN> Is it the compulsory acts of charity? Or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. Just which of those are you worried about?
<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> Hate speech, legal authorities agree, involves words directed against a category of persons. But does mocking Muhammad, burning a Koran, or calling Islam a cult constitute hate speech? Because, as she puts it, The solution to escalating violence and hate speech is not more hate speech. Hate pastor Terry Jones' Koran burning is "one hundred" percent off. Freedom of speech means the freedom to insult and be obnoxious. <CN> When was the last time you read any holy book?

<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> Merkel was named Time magazine's 2015 Person of the Year, largely due to her acceptance of nearly a million mostly Muslim asylum seekers. Many passages in all forms of religious texts are outdated and are considered criminal if carried out in today's time, but are still discussed as part of the faith. "The face they've seen of the West historically has been that of soldiers, missionaries, and today it's Britney Spears," said Grizwald. Thousands of angry protesters also stormed the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. Light, of Westwood, New Jersey, was helping her 13-year-old daughter prepare for a World History test when she discovered some rather shocking lessons. <CN> A book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? Shocking!
<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> The protest, despite instances of hate speech and stepping on the Koran, was peaceful. "In fact, I know a number of Muslims who hate Jews and are not self hating. No country likes its Muslim borders, Greece hates Turkey, India hates Pakistan, Egypt hates Israel, Sudan hates... <CN> The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences.
<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> "An apology for America's values is never the right course, Romney said.

<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of ISIS fighters are not particularly religious. The vast majority of Muslims recognize that his claims to religious authority are a farce. No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim. No religion condones the killing of innocents and the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim. Islam, as practiced by the vast majority of people, is a peaceful religion, a religion that respects others. <CN> Any religious text can be interpreted in many ways.

We further hope the Afghan people understand that the actions of a small number of individuals, who have been extremely disrespectful to the Holy Quran, are not representative of any of the countries of the international community who are in Afghanistan to help the Afghan people. The Associated Press reports that "Afghan protests against the burning of a Quran in Florida entered a third day with demonstrations in the east Sunday, while the Taliban called on people to rise up, blaming government forces for any violence ... "In view of the events of recent days, we feel it is important on behalf of ISAF and NATO members in Afghanistan to reiterate our condemnation of any disrespect to the Holy Quran and the Muslim faith," said Petraeus in a statement with NATO ambassador Mark Sedwill. issue travel alert due to Quran burn planVideo: North Caucasus market hit by suicide bombWorld Muslims condemn planned Fla. <CN> Have you really read Quran?

<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> These returnees from exile formed a resilient religion, Judaism, that has survived thousands of years. making the top 10.The Old Testament remains as a source of inspiration for parents today. Muslims also have a historical and present-day tradition of believing in distinct, separate roles for men and women. Many passages in all forms of religious texts are outdated and are considered criminal if carried out in today's time, but are still discussed as part of the faith. ♪ and nine times a week, every week, thousands of people come from across the country to watch their favorite bible stories come alive. <CN> If any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. Have you read the Bible's old testament?
<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> Instead of spreading the Quran's message of peace, they are spreading their own message of hatred — just as Jones has twisted the Bible's teachings of peace into a message of hatred. Bibles are burnt daily in Islamic countries - why the double standards? Arlington, Va.: Is their more than one version of the Quran? Actually I recommend, you the exercise Kurt Weiss did with Bible. So some little church in Fla. has a "Burn a Quran" day. <CN> How often have you read the Quran and thought about its teachings? Or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too.
<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> Muslims can influence the attitudes of Christians and Jews and hence the meanings of their texts. Muslims also have a historical and present-day tradition of believing in distinct, separate roles for men and women. But he believes the Bible has laid out spheres for men and for women that should last for all time. For a few days this year the world's media focused an intense spotlight on the drama of a modern-day inquisition. <CN> Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times.
<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> The answer written on the worksheet - the Christians harsh treatment of Muslims continues in the present day. When a presenter mentioned the Prophet Muhammad, the audience gave a thunderous reply honoring his name. His final one for the day said this: 9/11/2010 Int Burn a Koran Day. This post has been updated several times to reflect new developments during the course of the day. It follows the Pentecostal tradition, which teaches that the Holy Spirit can manifest itself in the modern day. <CN> I think any book written that long ago probably would.
<HS> If someone wrote the Koran to the present day it would not be allowed. <knowl> We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, he said, Jews and Hindus, and non-believers. He said the hallmarks of groups like Boko Haram are indoctrination, forced conversions, and kidnapping children. "Muslims also share suspicion of their own people in their homelands. Lang is also encouraging people to go online and join the conversation. But a clear snapshot of America is people who want to listen. <CN> In fact at no point does the Quran tell people to Hate or kill others. There are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. It does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion.
<HS> Islam and peace cannot coexist! <knowl> "The world has become less peaceful over the last year, mainly due to a rise in terrorist activity, the number of conflicts fought and the number of refugees and displaced people." According to Steve Killelea, founder of the Institute for Economics and Peace: If we took the Middle East out of the index over the last decade - and last year - the world would have become more peaceful. The rankings are drawn up by the Institute for Economics and Peace, an international think-tank that also issues a yearly Global Peace Index. By contrast, only ("only") 107,000 people have been killed in global terrorist incidents since 2000, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace. The Global Peace Index has measured unrest and conflict throughout the world for the past eight years and have said recent assessments show a declining trend. <CN> According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think tank which has produced the Global Peace index for the past 10 years, only Botswana, Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Mauritius, Panama, Qatar, Switzerland, Uruguay and Vietnam are free from conflict. Qatar has a sizable number of followers of Islam apparently.
<HS> Islam and peace cannot coexist! <knowl> Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges. Islamization occurs when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their so-called "religious rights. The Nordic Council has five countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden. Iran, on the other hand, is an overwhelmingly Shiite Muslim country. Denmark was in third place last year, behind Switzerland and Iceland. <CN> Iceland and Switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'Global Peace index'. Both have Muslim populations.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> If people don't like the culture and values of the West, they can go somewhere else. it is called a madrassa (Islamic seminary), people in the area view it like a good regular school. Seeing herself as a citizen of both East and West, El-Tantawy believes there is a widespread misconception in western society about the Muslim veil. The West can help by understanding Muslim society in a more nuanced and sophisticated way in order to interact with it wisely and for mutual benefit. Muslims now living the West should consider moving to one of these cultural paradises instead of struggling to change western society so they can be comfortable. <CN> By Western society do you mean your narrow view of what Western society should be?
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> In other words, many Western policies that aim to prevent terrorism may actually be causing it. About 1,000 people participated in most countries, but sample sizes were smaller in the three majority Muslim countries and in eight other countries. Once again, we heard a diversity of voices calling for respect and dignity. We can disagree in our diversity but within a civilian, peaceful and democratic framework. "He said he was concerned the decision could have reverberations in other European countries. <CN> The WE in WEstern symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true Westerner, respect others!!
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> "Look at the countries that are surveyed - Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Turkey," he says. It also ignores the fact that the number of attacks committed by Muslims in Western societies is quite low. The Islamic State's strategy is to polarize Western society — to destroy the grayzone, as it says in its publications. Roughly half of members in the denomination are from the United States. At the same most Muslims want to preserve the Islamic foundations of their society and want their public life to be infused with Islamic principles. <CN> Western Society seems pretty incompatible with Western Society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from Indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> "Oriental societies" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. People, go talk to some Muslims if you have any in your community. Ultimately, what happens among Western Muslims will define our ongoing struggle against Islamist terrorism. I ask you, would a western society riot over a cartoon to this extent? Muslims now living the West should consider moving to one of these cultural paradises instead of struggling to change western society so they can be comfortable. <CN> Why are you so sure of this? Muslims happily live in other Western societies without any problems.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> "These individuals are part of Western society, and their 'Canadianness' makes detection more difficult. Al Qaeda's model of rejecting all Western influences in favor of purely traditional society garners little support. And it's due, in part, to the effectiveness of ISIS propaganda. The kind of Islam being shaped there will affect wider society in years to come. Muslims now living the West should consider moving to one of these cultural paradises instead of struggling to change western society so they can be comfortable. <CN> I do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of Western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. Are you sure it is not Western society's intolerance that is the problem?
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> People said we couldn't find someone stylish on the Upper West Side. Migrants have come increasingly from outside developed economies, and they have come in accelerating numbers. On the other hand, there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. We strolled every block from Central Park West to Riverside Park, and from 76th to 81st Streets. Islam has helped rejuvenate the economy, and Ningxia has developed economic ties to Arab and Muslim countries. <CN> Perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from Islamic countries? While we're at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture?
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> If people don't like the culture and values of the West, they can go somewhere else. A civilized society should be able to cope with criticism, whether in a cartoon or in a important news story. It leaves Muslims isolated - anxious about Islam, anxious about the west. the modern madrassas are part of mainstream education infrastructure in West Bengal. Read about the "New law "Fiqh" of muslim minorities in the West". <CN> What do you mean? Provide positive news story re islam.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Unfortunately, elements of European society are reacting as the Islamic State desires. Now the minority problem lies hostage to the deteriorating health of European societies. Over the past year, Pope Francis has placed himself at the center of political conversations roiling the West, championing the plight of refugees while calling for more tolerance within European societies. "Oriental societies" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. But was complete assimilation to European ways feasible, or even desirable, for immigrants of various ethnic and religious backgrounds?Certainly, assimilation had made little difference to the fate of many in Europe in the first half of the 20th century. <CN> No, Muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within Europe, integrating with little issues in various European societies.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Now wouldn't people TOTALLY freak if someone started yelling BURN THE BIBLE. The God of the Torah, Bible, and Qu'ran is the same God; the differences lie mainly in practice. But it would be appropriate to ban Islam in the West since it is incompatible with Democracy and freedoms. One cartoon showed rolls of toilet paper marked Bible, Torah and Quran, and the explanation: In the toilet, all religions. The Reformation turned the people of the Dark Ages back to the Bible, with its deeply rooted respect for the individual. <CN> The Bible, the Quran and the Torah are very very similar in their teachings; if Muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible?
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> In Europe right now, those speaking most ardently for God tend to be Muslims. Europe's bigger problem is the divide between its Muslim and non-Muslim communities. In 2011, Gallup found that 56 percent of French Muslims felt Western societies "respected" Muslim societies. She is a political scientist, specializing in contemporary Islamic societies and Islam in Europe and in the United States. Impressionable young people should know that their communities reject violence, and Muslims should indeed speak out — and they do. <CN> Did you know that Muslims introduced universities to Europe? So the knowledge Western societies are built on.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> It's one of the core personal freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment. People should be free to follow their religious beliefs or lack therof. People in different traditions, with different ideological commitments, define religious freedom differently. And he affirmed Western values of democracy, human rights, religious freedom and women's right to self-determination -- all while making Muslims feel complimented, appreciated and understood. they are not there to change the West cultures and values as some people suggest. <CN> Islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the Western values you mean?
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Many Muslims believed they'd be targets of discrimination and prejudice due to the gunman at the siege being Muslim. There was also evidence of discrimination against atheists, Roman Catholics and pagans. Government agencies have been assiduous in documenting and fighting these types of discrimination. And finally, not all kinds of prejudice are affected by the same factors. Societies do not build trust automatically and so prejudice does not always fall away. <CN> I think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any Western society.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Ian West / PA via AP, fileRower Alex Partridge was one of two of British Olympic medal winners who had their medals stolen on Wednesday. Those people were sent to [Sudan] to train in terrorist camps and sent back to Nigeria. The likely explanation for the word first being used for e-mail originates in a Monty Python sketch. She asserted that "bartering is really good" and that people should "go ahead and barter with your doctor. One version of Rule 6 stated "There is no Rule 6," which is from a Monty Python sketch. <CN> Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> People should be free to follow their religious beliefs or lack therof. They're trying to make examples of people early on who have religious beliefs that homosexual conduct in the military is wrong, he said. Muslims now living the West should consider moving to one of these cultural paradises instead of struggling to change western society so they can be comfortable. Like followers of other faiths, Muslims can and do fulfill the personal religious obligations of their faith. It also ignores the fact that the number of attacks committed by Muslims in Western societies is quite low. <CN> Intolerance of other people's religious beliefs is incompatible with Western society.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> The children affected live in Deir al-Zour province in eastern Syria. Sophie Anderton, 26, LondonI think it is unacceptable to refuse to aid these vulnerable children. Kate Swinden, 61, BridlingtonThese are innocent children whose lives have been torn apart by war. People living in areas under Islamist rule have endured floggings, amputations and public executions, according to human rights groups and witnesses. In the West Africa country of Niger, 77% of women between the ages of 20 and 49 were married as children. <CN> Except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us?
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> — Heart Me (ha7mi) November 24, 2015#1in5Muslims are people - human beings - just like the other 4 and the rest of us. People should be free to follow their religious beliefs or lack therof. I think we have to be extremely vigilant in the Muslim community. People, go talk to some Muslims if you have any in your community. Will Washington Post provide an opportunity to the ex-muslims why they quit being muslims. <CN> That is an unusual thought. Muslims are human beings like the rest of us. And, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> In the decades of his rule, we have embraced diversity and democratic values. It affects the lives of people of great faith  or no faith at all. The people of Egypt will decide their representatives, their form of democratic government and the role of Islam in their lives. Polls show that nearly half of Americans have unfavorable views of Islam, and the fear of this faith in America is undeniable. This monolithic, negative portrayal provides a skewed image of Islam and Muslims. <CN> Complete freedom, justice and democratic values. The values at the heart of Islamic faith. I think they seem reasonable.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> It has taught people of different races to live in brotherhood and people of different creeds to live side by side in reasonable tolerance. These stories — of the silent majority of peaceful Muslims — are not headline-worthy. Suppose Williams had said something hurtful to gay people instead of to Muslims. Elsanousi is National Community Outreach Director of the Islamic Society of North America. We have to watch out for people who are trying to teach disaffected youths that it's the Muslims against the rest, a war of civilizations. <CN> Yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory Western society nowadays.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Muslims get blamed for terrorism even though the vast majority of us aren't terrorists. Islam, as practiced by the vast majority of people, is a peaceful religion, a religion that respects others. The vast, vast majority of Muslims in this country and around the world are moderate, are peaceful and are tolerant. This is what religion looks like for the vast majority of Muslims. A vast majority of Muslims reject the use of Shariah to legitimate terrorism. <CN> What makes 'all' Muslims incompatible with Western society? The vast majority of Muslims in Western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. There are only a few that have extremist anti-West views, these are not representative.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> "These individuals are part of Western society, and their 'Canadianness' makes detection more difficult. "Oriental societies" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. Al Qaeda's model of rejecting all Western influences in favor of purely traditional society garners little support. It also ignores the fact that the number of attacks committed by Muslims in Western societies is quite low. Globalization, the shaking up of continents, the ease of travel, and the doors for immigration flung wide open by Western liberal societies have given Qutb's worldview greater power and relevance. <CN> Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> People, go talk to some Muslims if you have any in your community. In turn, it wants refugees to equate the West with prejudice against Muslims and foreigners. If people don't like the culture and values of the West, they can go somewhere else. Having traveled abroad, I know that their ideals also inspire people around the world, especially in Muslim countries. If the West got out of Muslim lands tomorrow, would anything really get better for anyone in the Middle East? <CN> All Muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the Qu'ran.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Many of the comments written here reflect ignorance, prejudice and xenophobia. In combined figures for 2012-13, 16% of people questioned in inner London admitted to racial prejudice. The research found 41 per cent of people agreed or were undecided that Muslims "do not fit" Australian society. Racism will not be tolerated in South Tyneside and we are working to create a society that is free from prejudice. The West Midlands emerged as the place with the highest level of self-reported prejudice at 35% - a difference deemed statistically significant. <CN> Maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any Western society?
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> They are being advised by people who hate Muslims and Islam .... This habit of lying is being recognized as "Taqqiya" by the people here. What ever ideology drove him to want to kill those people should be hated. I ask you, would a western society riot over a cartoon to this extent? <CN> All people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any Western society.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> However, many Muslims do believe that America must back away from the Muslim world. If people don't like the culture and values of the West, they can go somewhere else. Waqf explains the goal in many quarters of restoring the Caliphate not just in the Mediterranean but also the entire West and, preferably, the world. The West can help by understanding Muslim society in a more nuanced and sophisticated way in order to interact with it wisely and for mutual benefit. Muslims now living the West should consider moving to one of these cultural paradises instead of struggling to change western society so they can be comfortable. <CN> Seems odd given that Western Society was built on the backs of the rest of the world.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Seeing herself as a citizen of both East and West, El-Tantawy believes there is a widespread misconception in western society about the Muslim veil. Unfortunately, elements of European society are reacting as the Islamic State desires. Islam is an evil cancer that must be removed from the west. "Oriental societies" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. To many in the West, Islamic State represents a medieval-style death cult. <CN> Except all of those which live and add to Western Societies.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> If people don't like the culture and values of the West, they can go somewhere else. Muslims now living the West should consider moving to one of these cultural paradises instead of struggling to change western society so they can be comfortable. "Ordinary people believe that a madrassa is a place where students are taught only religious subjects, and that it has no connection with modern education," Hossain said. the modern madrassas are part of mainstream education infrastructure in West Bengal. Read about the "New law "Fiqh" of muslim minorities in the West". <CN> Who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society?
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> People wake up, non of these 3 Abraham-based religions are the work of god. You people live in a morally disintegrated society of naked (free) people. Very few people actually follow the tenets laid down in these religions. Those "people" are responsible for the fact that it is complete failure. The only thing that religion does is tear people and societies apart. <CN> Muslims must show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to God.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Science thus shows one sole truth: creation as we know it from the Koran. But we can all take one crucial step starting now: stop letting ourselves be manipulated. As people get in a huffy over a bunch of stupid cartoons, every Muslim around the world should take a very deep breath and simply ask themselves one basic question: "What Would Muhammad Do?" either recognize this and act or get out of there,and let them continue killing one another,not our people. When we eat or drink or take drugs, and then sweat, residue of these substances come out with the water. <CN> Really? Even the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our NHS going? Those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> This image alone shows a staggering 442 homes apparently destroyed; an entire community. The reasons for why many Muslims are angry with the U.S. are well known. Editor's Note: Qasim Rashid is a national spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA. But that is not the same as singling out, stereotyping and harassing an entire community. But for many Muslims this pluralistic bonhomie masks an American narrative that is actually quite oppressive. <CN> All Muslims? That is a bit of an exaggeration I would say. Do not blame an entire community for actions of a few.
<HS> People that live in the West cannot live with Muslims. <knowl> Al Qaeda's model of rejecting all Western influences in favor of purely traditional society garners little support. "Mohammad Fazle Rabbi, president of West Bengal Board of Madrassa Education, said that the modernisation of the madrassas had benefitted the society immensely and that the process would continue. Hindus greatly suffered immmensely for hundreds of years, genocides and persecution first by the Moghuls, then by the colonialists. Afterward, the head of Europol noted that the scale of [violent extremism] has increased over the last 10 years. In 2007, West Bengal became the first state to begin the modernisation of the traditional madrassas with support from the federal government as part of the Prime Minister's 15-Point Programme for Minorities. <CN> Muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible.
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> What kind of putrid dogma should you believe in to forsake ones own child. Might it not be possible that in some instances one of the three natures predominates? Conclusion: Islam is a political ideology, albeit a primitive one, that is masquerading as a religion. "Islam is the faith of Allah, while the legislative councils are the faith of the ignorant. We know that Islamic governments often provide economic support for building large Islamic complexes in the US. <CN> The only ones in favour of Brexit are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is.
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> Islam is utterly incompatible with the rule of law as found in America. What kind of putrid dogma should you believe in to forsake ones own child. a couple of rotten shoes in the face.nothing fail nations like ignorant hypocritical heads. Might it not be possible that in some instances one of the three natures predominates? The issue here isn't how far the extremists go in one religion versus another religion. <CN> The only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that are ignorant about what they truly mean.
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> So please stop conflating criticism of Islam with discrimination of Muslims. Islam within itself, Islam itself means peace, the government video states. Islam did not attack the World Trade Center - al Qaeda did. Islam brings nothing but peace if you truly look into it. We are naiive if we think Islam can co-exist with Christianity. <CN> There's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is.
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> Islam teaches and requires that Muslims live as loyal citizens of the countries where they reside. Some of the photos showed pigs eating Islam's holy book, and women standing on the Quran. Understanding Islam, to a degree, means comprehending the Quran, which Muslims believe was revealed orally to the Prophet Mohammed 1,400 years ago. Therefore, many writers throughout different parts of Islamic history have criticized Islamic belief, including the prophet Muhammad and the Quran, without facing persecution. The parents say their children have been on edge since Jones started his "Islam is of the devil" campaign and the planned Quran burning. <CN> And tell me, how long did you spend studying the Quran? How long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with Muslims and their faith to understand them and Islam? How is it that you happen to know what Islam truly is?
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, was the living embodiment of the Koran. Show me all the successes in the Islamic world of having jihad considered in a higher sense. Islam claims that Koran is the direct word of Allah to man, and is for all time. The so called holy places of islam are really the holy places of the the religion of the times there. Those who mistreat women in so-called "Islamic states" violate the teachings of the Holy Koran and the Prophet of Islam. <CN> Yes, I am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the Koran and learning about Islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. That makes sense.
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> So please stop conflating criticism of Islam with discrimination of Muslims. The local community may not discriminate against them simply because they are Muslim. It happened because Islam is a sinister force, not necessarily all the Muslims. "Be aware that this war is a new crusade against the Islamic world. The position of Islam is very clear on one point, namely that the true Muslim cannot take a disinterested position vis-Ã -vis the state. <CN> The only ones against Islam and Muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is.
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> Our religion is Islam and is nothing close to this religion. Islam is a religion, and, as such, enjoys protection under the constitution. It's all shoving your religion in other people's faces to me. It was not Islam which drove airplanes into buildings and killed our people. Would Mr. Waters argue that an Islamic goverment money source is just a religion? <CN> What it really is is up for interpretation. Religions are practiced differently by different followers. Like any religion, some people follow it peacefully and some use it for their own means.
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> So please stop conflating criticism of Islam with discrimination of Muslims. Islam treats women as animals which shows how evil Islam is. We use the designation "moderate Islam" to differentiate it from "radical Islam." This monolithic, negative portrayal provides a skewed image of Islam and Muslims. The caricature of Islam as a violent and intolerant religion is horrendously incomplete. <CN> Maybe the ones intolerant of Islam and Muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is?
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> They are people who'd like to see a marriage between Islam and modernity. In Islam : The Untold Story , Holland deals with the origins of the religion Islam . He still tries to convert people to Islam, but it's not the same. Suddenly they were growing out Islamic beards and saying they were willing to die for Islam. Most people's first introduction to Islam is through the random terrorist plot they hear about on the news. <CN> What, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing Islam do not know what its really about?
<HS> If you support Islam and Muslims, it is because you do not know what they really are. <knowl> Millions of people were calling in, saying Donald Trump is right. Yet there is a real issue here of religious tolerance, affecting millions of people, and we should be able to discuss it. It's difficult to remember today that for decades, tens of millions of people around the world were greatly attracted to communism. Muhammad isn't simply a historical figure to them, but rather a personal inspiration to hundreds of millions of people around the world today. Holding fast to the principles of democracy, freedom and human rights, these hundreds of millions of Muslims fervently reject fanaticism in all its varied guises. <CN> What, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life?
<HS> The Sunnan Abu Dawud says that if a man has sex with an animal there will be no punishment. <knowl> In a nation where more than 60% of respondents support capital punishment, the shrill outcry over corporal punishment in our public schools is hypocritical to the point of being hysterical. According to some authority, there is no prescribed punishment (hudud) but only discretionary (Ta'azir) punishment that may involve even death sentence. "Properly defined, corporal punishment simply means "physical" punishment, or the intentional infliction of pain as a means of discouraging unacceptable behavior, while encouraging acceptable behavior. Here is what Abdur Rahman Doi writes on the punishment for sodomy:All Muslim jurists agree that sodomy is a sexual offence but differ in their punishment. In a 48-page opinion, the court said the "severe" punishment Wilson received and his mandated sex offender registration make "no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment. <CN> I do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. What is your point?
<HS> The Sunnan Abu Dawud says that if a man has sex with an animal there will be no punishment. <knowl> You're going to have candidates grasping for straws and grasping to get attention, Mr. Miner said. Who would have thought 45 years ago this day, we'd be more grasping at straws than grasping at stars. "Hate speech has no place online — or in society," Sandberg said. Indeed, it has specifically rejected attempts to target bigoted speech for special punishment, even when that speech fits within some First Amendment exception (such as fighting words); see here for more details. SUPPORTERS RALLY BEHIND CONVICTED EX-COP PETER LIANGThey are grasping at straws. <CN> I feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech.
<HS> The Sunnan Abu Dawud says that if a man has sex with an animal there will be no punishment. <knowl> According to Imam Abu Hanifa, the act of sodomy does not amount adultery and therefore there is no punishment by Hadd to be given to the offender except Ta'azir. Kelley defended the use of corporal punishment in the school system. And other animal lovers shared her home address on social media sites. "Practically, however, punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary. This crime deserves a first offense felony conviction, but since animal cruelty in Idaho is a misdemeanor unless it's the person's third offense, this person, when caught, may not get the punishment they deserve. <CN> Did you read the next line? It literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'.
<HS> Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously. <knowl> there is a person, some new convert into Islam of Armenian descent," Tsarni told CNN's Shannon Travis. Faraj, a stay-at-home mom, says she never saw herself "as a religious person, in the least," but became enthralled after trying to learn more about Islam before a visit to see her husband's family. Those who say that Islamic Jihad was merely for the defense of the 'homeland of Islam' diminish the greatness of the Islamic way of life. <CN> Since when having a family is portrayed in such a dehumanizing way?
<HS> Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously. <knowl> there is a person, some new convert into Islam of Armenian descent," Tsarni told CNN's Shannon Travis. Islamic dress is now compulsory for women studying at Al Azhar. After spending 18 months learning about Islam, she decided to convert. Wearing a hijab "reminds me to be a good person," she said. three women say they came to Islam after much thought and spiritual searching. <CN> Are you sure? 12 Muslim Nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise.
<HS> Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously. <knowl> Islam never gives up what it conquers, be it religion, culture, language or life. <CN> How can you use such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people?
<HS> Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously. <knowl> Where are all the Islamic inventions or improvements in the lives of people. Saying that democracy and religion (Islam) can coexist is too general of a statement. All examples of people cashing in on the irrational fear of poor peaceful Islam. Not a single person of islamic faith had been in anyway injured to person or reputation. Islam is a faith of 1.5 billion strong and growing...1.5 billion people that adhere to Islam's message of peace, social justice and equality. <CN> Replace Islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is.
<HS> Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously. <knowl> Our national conversation about Islam is focused on the wrong issues. Islam calls this duty "commanding the right and forbidding the wrong." The researchers based their work on a pool of roughly 11,000 teachers. The feeling of shame is shared by officials, civil serv­ants, doctors, journalists, busi­nessmen and teachers. In 2011, about 1.8 million U.S. adults were Muslim, and about 20 percent had converted to the faith, Pew researchers say. <CN> So, you say that highly educated Muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? Sorry, but you got this so wrong.
<HS> Islam is brainwashing its faithful. It is a horrible cult made of persons that reproduce continuously. <knowl> Leaving the faith is a particularly sensitive issue in Islam, which was initially founded in part as a sort of community. We're saving Islam by showing the emerging generation how they can be part of a pluralistic world and be faithful Muslims. The view is especially rare among Central Asian and European Muslims. Where Islam is in the minority (as in Thailand, the Philippines and Europe) there is the threat of violence if Muslim demands are not met. <CN> A large proportion of NHS workers are Asian, and many Muslim. Without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service.
<HS> Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence. <knowl> During the Crimean War of 1853 to 1856, sometimes called the first modern war, Muslims could be found on all sides. Islamists are precisely those about whom the Koran warned Muslims, the 'Munafiqun' (the hypocrites). "This is a war with radical Islam, it is not a war with Islam. We should be careful about applying a separate standard to the Muslim world concerning violence. Rather than containing violence, the war on terror turned the whole world into a battlefield. <CN> Muslims many times have shown how supportive they are of other communities. It does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war?
<HS> Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence. <knowl> Reality TV NewsEvelyn Lozada and Chad Johnson's new reality show is being scrapped. Stop wars, than go play a video gamei don't believe video games cause violence. Integrating these aspirations with liberal ideas of democracy and freedom of religion is a decidedly challenging endeavor. The company's chief creative, James Peo, is a certified optician, which allows Protos to market prescription lenses, too. Violent video games as well as horror films and films celebrating violence are likely harmful for the development of character. <CN> My optician seems like a nice fellow, so I wonder why you think he is likely to kick off at a moment's notice.
<HS> Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence. <knowl> Disputes and commentary about sacred scripture are not a modern, liberal betrayal of Islamic tradition. But it's hard to make the jump from there" to winning a war of ideas with ISIS.In any case, "The Study Quran" may not be universally accepted by American Muslims. "But they can explain that war and violence were always understood as a painful part of the human condition. So Hamid said he is somewhat skeptical about what if any effect the "The Study Quran" could have on counterterrorism. After praising God, the Quran's first surah (chapter) rebukes sinners who anger the Almighty or wander from the faith. <CN> My dentist told me the Quran says: 'GOD does not love the aggressors.'?
<HS> Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence. <knowl> Before my time, the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan horrified many Muslims. However, many Muslims do believe that America must back away from the Muslim world. If you say anything critical or questioning about Muslims, they'll burn down your house. But for many Muslims this pluralistic bonhomie masks an American narrative that is actually quite oppressive. Integrating these aspirations with liberal ideas of democracy and freedom of religion is a decidedly challenging endeavor. <CN> How did you make that conclusion, by observation or speculation? I personally know many Muslims and they are all very respectful, nice and kind. They also invite me for dinners.
<HS> Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence. <knowl> Violence in video games is little different than other forms of violence. Not through wars and weapons and not through any form of violence. The title game isn't going to be about the West Coast offense or fancy passing or any of the things the NFL loves to promote. To address the reality of it, it's like dealing with people in a parallel dimension. The Council of Islamic Ideology was created so that legislators can seek clerics' advice before implementing legislation. <CN> If you would know more about Islamic ideology, you would agree that Islam is not only about war and violence. It encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. You confuse Muslims in general with armed bands!
<HS> Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence. <knowl> I view my work as being about reality — a hyper-reality, but reality. Stop wars, than go play a video gamei don't believe video games cause violence. American politics should be about ideas, not about who can land a more ferocious uppercut. From gang war to peaceDuggan and Irizarry take full responsibility for their situations and acknowledge their role in the violence. I have no problem keeping these games from my kid, but I am worried about others from her generation being desensitized to violence. <CN> No. This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
<HS> Liberal ideas are wrong, they want us to think that Islam is good but in reality it is a cult about war and violence. <knowl> Trump also revealed his breathtaking ignorance about the reality of rape—not to mention sweeping racism—when he suggested that Mexican immigrants to the U.S. were responsible for perpetrating crimes, including rape. In the past, it has taken gruesome cases of violence to ensure coverage of rape. And about 68% of assaults go unreported, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. The root cause of those crimes are violence against women (whether the man or woman was the murderer). India has a long history of tolerance of sexual violence, but a series of high-profile rape cases have triggered strong public outrage in recent years, leading to tougher anti-rape laws. <CN> There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it's better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Once you adjust, 22 or 23 hours is not that hard, says Syed Asif Ali, president of the Islamic Society. Some of them have spoken out bravely against the Islamic State. Religion and culture are not the same thing though in most cases there will be influences of each on the other. Many followers of Islam have been indoctrinated by the radicalizing culture of the mosque and have become isolated from our society. But they also throw light on the character of British society today. <CN> It seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of Islam? If yes, this does not make any sense. They contribute to the society like any other individual is.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> When faced with such diversity, there are no hard and fast rules for Muslim identity. The war being waged by the US/UK & co is a war against Islam & Muslims. I work with my father, and, once, we were seeking business with a white American man who had married a Muslim woman. Warsi also condemns the lack of ministerial engagement with a cross-government working group combating anti-Muslim hatred, in which she was involved. Many commentators and politicians approach integration as a cultural question, arguing that more should be done to persuade British Muslims to accept British values. <CN> Muslims contribute much to the UK, through their hard work and charitable activities.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> "Well, I know he's not really Muslim," I would quickly add. After 9/11, many African-American Muslims said they believed their "identity is". Many traditional and religious Muslims find their spouses through arranged or semi-arranged marriages. For many Muslims, supporting Shariah may mean no more than an affirmation of identity. Radical religious groups give these culturally homeless Muslims a sense of certainty, purpose and structure. <CN> Muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known Doctors and Professors.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> He lauded the soldiers and police officers who fought such terrorists. A Medford Police officer faces potential discipline for sharing a graphic on Facebook that incites violence against Muslims, Wicked Local reported. Swedish police officers swiftly ushered Vilks from the room unharmed while subduing the crowd. He lunged at police officers who brought him to the ground with a stun gun. The commission provides credit for police officers who participate in training events and reviews trainers' qualifications. <CN> A part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. Who identify as muslim?
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> She figured it would take a decade to become an Olympic medal contender. REUTERS/Sergio MoraesRIO DE JANEIRO, June 28 (Reuters) - Ask athletes what goes into Olympic gold medals, and they will likely say sweat and years of training. Conker is filthy and funny, and it plays like a perverse, longform Monty Python sketch. If she works that hard and still can't win an Olympic medal, what's the point? One version of Rule 6 stated "There is no Rule 6," which is from a Monty Python sketch. <CN> Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> To meet this challenge, Muslims must reassess their own involvement, behavior and contributions in American society. The cultural gap between most Southeast Asian Muslims and Arab Muslims might even help bin Laden in some cases, said Van Doorn-Harder. Once you have a Muslim parent, especially a dad, you're in. That's why we need to fight [against] the culture, not the Muslims. RT AJStream: Are African-American #Muslims left out of #BlackHistoryMonth in the US? <CN> True, nothing except 31 billion pounds to the economy and 70,000 jobs through Muslim-owned firms in London alone.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> The FBI says threatening phone messages were left last Friday night. There are community iftars (the meal that breaks the daily fast during the holy month of Ramadan), cultural outreach through plays, open mic nights, book signings and interfaith services. The way I was exposed to religion was mutually exclusive with culture. It was also the first question I was asked as I was escorted off an easyJet plane with my sister and brother at 6am last Wednesday morning at Stansted airport. To define India's food culture as vegetarian is, therefore, lazy and disingenuous. <CN> Who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night?
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Every year Muslims contribute over £31 billion to the UK economy. One recent poll found that British Muslims donate more money to charity than any other religious group. The paintings of Muhammad are superb and form a significant part of the manuscript's pictorial programme. Charity: water started four years ago as a fundraising group promoting clean water in poverty-stricken countries. I worry that our institutions of culture and learning are muting these significant Islamic works of figural art due to a variety of fears. <CN> Muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the UK economy and make up a significant part of our NHS workforce. I think that is quite a nice contribution.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> He also loves British humour and is a big fan of Monty Python and Little Britain. One of those sports heroes is, Mr Trump, someone you've met before. An important goal of Python 's developers is making it fun to use . I chose Python as a working title for the project , being in a slightly irreverent mood ( and a big fan of Monty Python 's Flying Circus ) . The design of Python offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition . <CN> Except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. Anyone else a fan of Monty Python?
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> And how the history of that money has revealed itself in our economy. Culture of tolerance: There is a culture of tolerance by silence for fundamentalist views in Islam. It takes more than a few steps of reasoning to see how NASA influences a culture and how that culture innovates, creates the economies of tomorrow, stabilizes and then grows your economy. "It should be needless to say ... that it is unacceptable to ban Danish food culture, including dishes with pork," he wrote. On its website, the Danish Agriculture and Food Council states that the consumption and export of pork are crucial to Denmark's economy. <CN> How about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. Should I go on?
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Radical religious groups give these culturally homeless Muslims a sense of certainty, purpose and structure. Communities can make it harder for terrorists to recruit by helping the culturally homeless feel more at home. The series tracks five Muslim families living around Dearborn, Michigan, home to one of the nation's largest Muslim enclaves. To do this is to deny the cultural diversity that exists among the more than one billion Muslims around the world. The coziness of a discrete and - well, slightly insular, contained cultural-religious identity is a comforting thing to come home to. <CN> If it wasn't for a Muslim I would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> They don't have professional experience, but they're passionate about sharing their culture through food, Manal adds. To me, that speaks to something that is more culturally acceptable about food in America than language or even religion. Asha is simpler than and some foods consumed include fatayer , hummus bi tahini , a variety of salads and a Levantine - style omelette called . Hummus is often slathered in olive oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika , oregano and pine nuts ; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank . Palestinian culture and life revolves around food in every aspect , whether it is an ordinary day or a special occasion such as a wedding or holiday . <CN> Who do you think introduced the West to Shawarma, Hummus, and all the rest of the Middle Eastern and Asian food you love?
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Incidents of extremist activity are often followed by anti-Islam protests or hate crimes. Such a perversion of the religious pillars makes Charlie Hebdo's cartoons tame by comparison. They could enjoy the "privilege" of living under Islamic "protection" (read: not be attacked by Islam), if they paid a tax. The products of an adversarial culture, these immigrants and their religion, Islam, are patiently conquering Europe's cities, street by street. "The historical and cultural context of the artwork was an especially important element for the large number of visitors who gathered in a special multimedia section explaining the history of Islamic religion and civilization. <CN> Islamic civilization led Europe out of dark ages into the era of Enlightenment and gave rise to its Renaissance. Now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the UK economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> But one important contributing factor has not improved - widespread anger at America in the Muslim world. In the middle of the 20th century, there were virtually no Muslims in Western Europe, Mr. Caldwell writes. Mustafa Akyol is a contributing opinion writer and the author of Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty. During the seventh-century leadership of the Prophet Muhammad, whose authority was accepted by all believers, Muslims were a united community. While discrimination by both Hindus and the British played a role, it was as if the whole of Muslim society had retreated to lick its collective wounds. <CN> Muslims have been part of the British fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Radical religious groups give these culturally homeless Muslims a sense of certainty, purpose and structure. We're going to have to look at a lot of things very closely, Trump said. We empathize with the citizens of France as they go through a healing process and return to everyday life, he said. In my book, that makes you a Muslim--maybe not a card-carrying one, but part of the flock for sure. The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. <CN> Do you know that you are using a lot of things in your everyday life that Muslims invented, right?
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> They are all totally different cultures and races even though they are more than 90% muslims. For people who already feel culturally homeless, discrimination by the adopted society can make matters worse. Because religion should teach that all people are created equal, it should not discriminate based on race, color, age, or nationality. "Addressing this injustice is something that should be welcomed by everybody, it is essential for a multi-faith and multi-cultural society. But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. <CN> This may disappoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Hawker centres, or open air food courts, have come to define Singaporean food culture. After all, each dish has a story to tell about Singaporean culture and history. So Birmingham, a big melting pot city, has had plenty of friction with different cultures. Look at the flipside: Food also lasts longer than any other aspect of immigrant culture. "Good Morning America," particularly in its second hour, has an even greater pop culture emphasis. <CN> I take it you have never eaten a curry then?
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> "Those who are spreading messages of intolerance and hatred must not go unchallenged. Detectives do not believe the attacks were motivated by hatred of Muslims, Boyce said. But these contradictions are not primarily between sectors of Muslim society but rather within Muslim individuals. As to my original reason for seeing the film, to learn whether it incites hatred of Muslims and Arabs? Aklit said he was sure the murders at the magazine's premises would end up fuelling more hatred of Muslims. <CN> What is your hatred of Muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide?
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> "It's a position that's highly unusual in the Muslim world and one that has surprised Islamic scholars. Instead, we must engage with Islamic scholars to counter violent extremism. These references may be obscure, but the fact that other Islamic scholars ignore them gives the Islamic State an upper hand, Hassan says. They unfurled banners that read, among other things Allah - Just for Muslim. ISIS claims the Quran justifies taking non-Muslim women and girls captive and permits them to be raped -- an assertion denied by Islamic scholars. <CN> The knowledge western society is built on was discovered by Islamic scholars, then colonists claimed it as their own. Our society would not be so developed without Muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Other billionaire givers include self-made investor Eli Broad, who is worth $6.9 billion. The pork industry produces 24 billion pounds a year of pork products, from tenderloin to bacon, its most popular product. He has spent his career working with clients across all industry sectors, including Fortune 500 organizations and small and medium enterprises. Bill and Melinda Gates once again top the annual ranking of charity givers, followed by the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. Mr Quaedvlieg said about 300 businesses had put in expressions of interest to become accredited and the program "has to incorporate small and medium enterprises". <CN> Unless you consider spending over 20 Billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in London and that is before we talk about the international contribution.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> According to an analysis last year in the journal Patient Safety in Surgery, 46% to 65% of adverse events in hospitals are related to surgery, especially complex procedures. More important, we need to change the way hospitals are paid. Hospitals are taking steps to better predict who will have the highest risk of complications from surgery or anesthesia, including those who are in poor health to begin with. Indeed, concerns about modesty can play out in unexpected ways in hospital settings. The consequences of surgical error are huge, both for patient health and hospital finances. <CN> Hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. I could go on.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Politicians constantly call for a defense of British values against extremism. But they also throw light on the character of British society today. This killing of a young British soldier was not an act of insanity. The Victorian adventurer Richard Burton undertook the Hajj disguised as an Afghan doctor. A far-right British activist has a bone to pick with his "gay" dog. <CN> The 26% of NHS doctors who are Asian/Asian British beg to differ.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> On Thursday, Kenyatta lauded Farah, telling parliament that the Muslim man "refused to be divided by terrorism," BBC News reported. That's why we need to fight [against] the culture, not the Muslims. Mr. Aidi meets others there who are simply searching for a Muslim-friendly environment. For many Muslims, supporting Shariah may mean no more than an affirmation of identity. <CN> Muslims feed the homeless London, Cardiff, Birmingham (everywhere) BBC news; Muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> Others embraced the modern ways of their new rulers, seeking Muslim advancement through the pursuit of Western sciences, culture and law. Islam survived and continues to survive because Muslims believe we have to respect and take care of each other, as members of the umma. Radical religious groups give these culturally homeless Muslims a sense of certainty, purpose and structure. A 2006 poll found that 40 percent of Muslims would welcome Shariah law in Britain. Reports of the Islamic State luring Western Muslims abroad are followed by a tightening of homeland security policy. <CN> Muslims have contributed much to the UK due to their sterling educational achievements. More than half of Muslim schools in England surpass the national percentage GCSE average of 5 or more GCSE's or equivalent A*-C grades including English and Math GCSEs. This enables Muslims to work in important fields of Medicine and Law amongst others to enrich the lives of UK citizens.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> San Francisco hotels pay roughly $250 million in taxes a year. Airbnb estimates it would pay about $12 million in hotel taxes. Nor would paying for all promised benefits with higher taxes be desirable. It pays to underscore this advice because taxes can be a doozy. Get all the latest news and information on paying your federal taxes. <CN> Clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? This is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms!
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> This is not a time for intellectual, social, political, economic or cultural isolation. Having an official culture and an unofficial subculture is not a new thing. The first two statements are the necessary postures of a liberal and democratic society. Public voices have a responsibility for generating a climate of xenophobia, fear and hate. While these sentiments have been described as racism, Islamophobia or xenophobia, they are all related. <CN> Maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> He is known for his generosity to many charitable causes in Malaya and Singapore during the British colonial era . The Current Discussion: What did you think of Obama's speech in Cairo? For example, we asked whether it's acceptable to engage in violent jihad. We have contributed to many charitable causes but have never sought publicity for doing so. In other words, many Western policies that aim to prevent terrorism may actually be causing it. <CN> A core duty of being a Muslim is to conduct Zakat (the word for charity in Arabic). The Prophet Mohammad stated that: 'The believer's shade on the Day of Resurrection will be his charity.' Because of their inspiration, Muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity on the global scale and their local societies across the UK.
<HS> Muslims cannot add any value to our culture. <knowl> But what if it's a map of independent coffee shops serving up free Wi-Fi that you want? Azalea, who's frequently been held up as a poster child for cultural appropriation in the music industry, responded on Twitter. A music video was filmed in support of the song . " Clocks " is a song by British alternative rock band Coldplay . Users should be able to turn map features on and off. <CN> What have Muslims ever done for us? Well, Coffee, Clocks, Cameras, Hygiene, Universities, Surgical Instruments, Maps, Music, Algebra.
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> The Quran guarantees freedom of speech on four occasions, teaching Muslims to respond to people who criticize their faith by asking for proof of their claim. On the contrary, the vast majority care intensely about the progress of their nation. We can build relationships — have-a-neighbor-over-to-dinner relationships — with people of other faiths. On the other hand, there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. Meet the Press on Sunday, came after host Chuck Todd asked if a presidents faith should matter. <CN> Don't mix up politics and faith. No faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story.
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> Forty percent of Americans associate Muslims and the Islamic faith with violence, according to a Pew Research Center survey. The French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo skewers people of all faiths and backgrounds. Hillary Clinton refused to declare war on ISIS Sunday, defending her position that followers of the terrorist organization should not be called radical Islamic terrorists. King's recent congressional hearings, which drew much heat, focused on the radicalization of American Muslims. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of ISIS fighters are not particularly religious. <CN> The vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church.
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> Most people across the subcontinent said they do not know much about the other religion. Corporal punishment is protected by a 1977 Supreme Court decision, which ruled that physical discipline in schools didn't violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. England & Wales introduced a census question on religion in 2001. Trump insists that he will not be silenced on this issue. "Many Muslims want religion to play a role in politics," he says. <CN> No religion encourages violence towards others. I do not think it is a muslim issue at all.
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> Islam within itself, Islam itself means peace, the government video states. On Morning Joe today, Bloomberg's John Heilemann asked Trump directly whether he thinks Islam is an inherently violent or peaceful religion. They were given two choices: Islam is an inherently violent religion, which leads its followers to violent acts and Islam is an inherently peaceful religion, but there are some who twist its teachings to justify violence. The very word islam comes from a word cognate to shalom, which means peace in Hebrew. Since our values and messages are based purely on the documented teachings of Islam, we simply speak for what Islam teaches. <CN> The very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion.
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> Calls to end corporal punishment have gotten louder of late, even in states unlikely to pass a ban. A Pew Research Center survey, released on Thursday, finds that 82% of Americans believe Muslims face discrimination in the United States. I've had to cut people out of my life, people I consider friends, because I'm not going to accept it. But at a banquet for volunteers on Friday, 120 people at the Irish American Home gave Corporal Jimenez a long standing ovation. South Dakota has no reference to corporal punishment in state laws. <CN> Aren't there a lot of people in Britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? Or is that different?
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> "The punishment of Badawi for criticizing Islam as sparked an international outcry. "Properly defined, corporal punishment simply means "physical" punishment, or the intentional infliction of pain as a means of discouraging unacceptable behavior, while encouraging acceptable behavior. They are no better than the Westborough Baptist Church in terms of representing their religion. Islam as an entire religion is responsible, they cry: it is incompatible with western values. In a nation where more than 60% of respondents support capital punishment, the shrill outcry over corporal punishment in our public schools is hypocritical to the point of being hysterical. <CN> Sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion.
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> Any god that relies on mere mortals to mete out eternal punishment on his behalf is a god of very questionable "almightyness". The people of Islam will get their just punishment in due time. Most Muslim countries today no longer impose the jizya tax on non-Muslims. But even depictions of Mohammed by Muslim artists have been a sensitive issue. And on a range of issues, Islam can fairly be described as feminist. <CN> Just to note that muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. The violence seems to be your issue.
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> NATO soldier killing innocent people is far more painful than the burning of a Quran. No true Muslim can do what Osama Bin Laden had done. If people commit harm against innocent people, it will be in violation of the spirit of Islam and a violation of the concept of jihad. It preys on the religiously ignorant and keeps recruits isolated from mainstream Muslims.

<HS> Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical. <knowl> By Seth Borenstein, AP Science WriterScience is getting a grip on people's fears. But it becomes destructive when people resist government because of irrational fears and suspicions. Fearing people who ascribe to the ideology presented in the Quran and Hadith is not irrational. Science and faith are fundamentally incompatible, and for precisely the same reason that irrationality and rationality are incompatible. Many people who refuse to vaccinate their children do not fit the profile of irrational science skeptics; they are affluent and well-educated. <CN> No, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science.

<HS> Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical. <knowl> And indeed, science has brought us an immense amount of understanding. Notices of the American Mathematical Society and MAA FOCUS ran memorial articles on Ross . But the idea of a human-centered mathematics may be gaining force and respect. While science is anchored in observations of the physical world, Dr. Hersh insists that mathematics is more of a human creation, like literature, religion or banking. Dr. Rees also had an important role in the growth and diversification of mathematical studies. <CN> Actually all modern science and mathematics are children of Islam.
<HS> Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical. <knowl> This point gets to the heart of the difference between science and religion. We've killed more Muslims than they've killed us by an awful lot. This lack of interest in science contrasts sharply with the worldwide interest in religion. <CN> Are you sure? There are an awful lot of Muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science.
<HS> Islam cannot get along with science because is illogical. <knowl> Unlike Christianity where Religion and Science are two separate elements, the study of Science has always been compatible with Islam. I believe faith & science are compatible, & go hand in hand. But the existence of religious scientists, or religious people who accept science, doesn't prove that the two areas are compatible. science of people " ) , which contains details about the transmitter are scrutinized .

His latest book, Religion and the Sciences of Origins: Historical and Contemporary Discussions, is a broad survey of the many challenges that modern science-in particular the biological sciences-poses to traditional religious doctrines.

<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> And certainly that is what is happening to many of the ancient churches of the Middle East. There are other Arab churches in New York, but Salam Arabic is truly a kaleidoscope of Middle East Christianity. The Salam Arabic Lutheran Church has become a home for Arab Christians, many of whom fled the Middle East. He said: Christians are being persecuted throughout the Middle East and elsewhere. The Middle East continued to be a major hub of anti-Christian persecution. <CN> So i guess you are talking about the Middle East? That place where Christianity originated from. Sure.
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> Central and South American countries are heavily rooted in the Roman Catholic church. Like Mr. Schönborn, the churches of Europe should reassert the fundamental values of their religions.

Fears and worries murmur like prayers beneath the hammered crosses of the Church of the Virgin Mary. <CN> Sorry I must have missed that episode of grand designs, link?
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> Rockwell believed that Freedom of Worship and Freedom of Speech were his better results in the series .

<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> When it thinks of opportunities, economic reform, and change, it heads towards countries like Turkey, France, and Qatar. Remember you are in a Muslim country, so a strict dress code is enforced and women are obliged to cover their head. In practice, this often seems to mean the religious expression of Muslims. The UAE was one of the 14 countries where Iraqi expatriates were able to take part in their country's elections last month through an out-of-country voting programme organised by the International Organisation for Migration. When Syria thinks of threats, it looks towards countries like Russia or Iran. <CN> There are churches in Muslim countries like Turkey, UAE, Morrocco. What is your point?
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> HYPOCRITES, ALL OF THEM.This country was built on freedom of religion. People filled with hate and intolerance who worshiped a distortion of the Muslim faith are responsible. Like Mr. Schönborn, the churches of Europe should reassert the fundamental values of their religions. People of the Muslim faith (not the hijackers and extremists) were killed in those towers also, I presume. They know that many American values -- freedom of religion, human dignity and opportunity for prosperity -- are Muslim values too." <CN> Because we believe in freedom of religion here. Why should it bother anyone else for Muslims to practice their faith peacefully alongside others?
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> Still, there remains a common unity between the people of the country. In many Muslim countries, Christians are not allowed to put up new churches nor build any churches that are higher than mosques. Central and South American countries are heavily rooted in the Roman Catholic church. site?That's it, get rid of every single Christian church in this country. People who skew religion to justify their political beliefs are not real religious people. <CN> Why should not Muslims be allowed to build Mosques here? I thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than Christianity?
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> They want their mosques to have the same kind of amenities that many churches offer. Like Mr. Schönborn, the churches of Europe should reassert the fundamental values of their religions. Let me be clear, he said, the monarch must be in communion with the Church of England, because he or she is the head of the church. In this view of things, gods of various kinds watch over the hubbub, and all is largely well. So the national Church of England and Church of Scotland, seem to have been particularly effective in generating 'no religion'. <CN> For hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of Churches in Britain, but we are better than that now.
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> In the 17 months since, Keller's team has been working tirelessly to rebuild the Chevelle in Sacred Heart Cathedral's garage. Our community is in pain; our teachers are scared, said Jessica Hyman, a senior at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory, one of the four schools in the archbishop's jurisdiction. It's not always about winning, said Prolific Prep coach Philippe Doherty, a former coach at Sacred Heart Cathedral and USF. Also devastated is the Episcopal Church's Holy Trinity Cathedral, known for its murals of Bible stories with all black figures. "Last year, Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory in San Francisco apologized for omitting a picture of a female student who wore a tux. <CN> Surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! Read on. Sacred Heart Cathedral in Lahor, Holy Trinity Cathedral in Karachi.
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> In many Muslim countries, Christians are not allowed to put up new churches nor build any churches that are higher than mosques. Unlike most countries that have an army, in the case of Pakistan, the army has a country. Akbar Ahmed: I don't think non-Muslims are treated badly in Muslim countries, I was educated by Catholic and Presbyterian teachers in the mountains of Pakistan. There are huge swaths of the world which are now experiencing a very sharp decline in the number of Christians. The Inquisition was carried out in the name of the Catholic Church. <CN> Because we let people practise their religion here? Also, there a number of christian churches built in Pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in Muslim countries too.
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> HYPOCRITES, ALL OF THEM.This country was built on freedom of religion. Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric and threatening to bans Muslim immigration or engage in special surveillance of Muslims "hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. Like Mr. Schönborn, the churches of Europe should reassert the fundamental values of their religions. The deamand for a conversion over to Sharia law to show how tolerant our Government is of a Muslim's right to freedom of religion? The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of ISIS fighters are not particularly religious. <CN> If a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. The vast majority of Muslims support people's right to freedom of religion.
<HS> If I cannot go to their countries and build a church, why should they come to our countries and build mosques? <knowl> Other religious groups also outperform British Muslims: 30.1 per cent of Sikhs have degrees, and 44.6 per cent of Hindus. In this case, the often criticised Muslim Council of Britain, is the Government's partner - as are those leading the schools, mosques and charities working with British Muslims. Of course, Western countries have been free of the kinds of violent attacks on Christians and other religious groups that have occurred in countries such as Egypt and Syria in recent years. The government has alreadyÂ acknowledged that Muslims suffer from "a consistently higher level of unfair treatment than ... most other religious groups". Muslim leaders are telling their followers that the stunt has been widely condemned by Christian and other religious groups and should be ignored. <CN> British Muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a Mosque], so I am struggling to see the problem with Mosques where these funds are mostly raised.

ISTANBUL — We Muslims like to believe that ours is a religion of peace, but today Islam looks more like a religion of conflict and bloodshed. <CN> Religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace.
<HS> They constantly say that their religion is a 'religion of peace', maybe because in reality it isn't. <knowl> Has anyone ever heard anyone say, "Buddhism is a religion of peace?"

If Islam is a religion of peace, I am the ambassador to France. Islam is a religion of peace...Repeat sufficiently, and maybe it will become true. <CN> So you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? This is ignorant.

<HS> We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us. <knowl> An example is the Against Violent Extremism network sponsored by Google Ideas in 2011. There is no country in the world that is more racked by terrorism than Syria, Turnbull said. That included operational and policy responses, as well as efforts to work with communities to counter violent extremism. The initiative was about backing community-based and non-government groups to help people steer away from violent extremism. Safe Spaces aims to increase Muslim-American communities' resilience against violent extremism through community-led prevention and intervention activities. <CN> In fact, Muslims have continued to help our society. For instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. Muslims also have condemned terrorism and ISIS in plentiful news medias around the world.
<HS> We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us. <knowl> Bahrain ranked as the best country to join local community groups and coordinate health care. Today, we see a secular culture celebrating the spring equinox, whilst religious culture celebrates the resurrection. The country's growing middle class belongs mostly in the local tier, with some moving up to the glocal tier. Many religious liberals and atheists agree that both theism and atheism are sufficiently moral and practical to generate similarly successful cultures. These days, flush with oil cash, more Arab tourists than ever are showing up on the tiny street and finding in the spruced-up restaurants and shisha (water pipe) cafes the ambience of their native countries  with fewer of the cultural strictures. <CN> I am no expert but I do not see Islam as a single, mono-culture any more than Christianity is. Surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures.
<HS> We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us. <knowl> Those not meeting the requirements would have to return to their native countries. "Others get the word that fasting should begin by checking Web sites in their native countries. Does Ramadan start when religious officials in your native country declare that a legitimate witness has seen the moon? It is a failed society, I am stretching the word society. Since October, more than 52,000 undocumented children have been detained after fleeing crime, violence and poverty in their native countries including Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras,. <CN> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith who adds so much to society?
<HS> We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us. <knowl> Michael Gove argues that school children should be taught British values. But we also need more of a spirit of unity, compassion and kindness that brings people together under our common British values of tolerance, democracy, equality and respect.1. Casey Review says thousands of Muslims live in isolated enclaves with their own housing estates, schools and television channelsIMMIGRANTS should take an integration oath and there should be more emphasis on British values in schools, a report has found. A bunch of cat-adoring, bow-tie wearing wits?Tell us whether you agree, and if not, what you think British values are, or should be. Take this British values questionnaire to find out if you fit in or, with all due respect, if you should be on the next flight to Loserville. <CN> I have met so many Muslim people adhering to British values. What do you base your view on?
<HS> We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us. <knowl> With tensions rising in his host country, he faces the prospect of forced repatriation along with nearly 3 million other Afghans to a homeland still in conflict. A few hundred years ago, Native American tribes in what's now the northeastern United States kept track of seasons by ascribing particular names to each full moon. The forced repatriation appears to be happening in large waves this week. "We want good relations with Pakistan, and we want peace for both countries. More than 20 million visitors have come to the country so far this year. <CN> I am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation.
<HS> We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us. <knowl> Those not meeting the requirements would have to return to their native countries. How many of those renunciations do you think might have been same-sex couples? Boehner is saying the Hastert Rule needn't preclude passage of something with citizenship in it. But you could, I suppose, imagine a scenario in which some combination of enforcement and citizenship has a majority of House Republicans but not enough support to pass without Dems. But there's another group of Americans who could be adding to that tally: same-sex couples. <CN> There seems to be a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some faraway coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there.
<HS> We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us. <knowl> This vile act offended not only a free and sovereign country, but his own voters as well. He used the president of Mexico and all of the country's citizens to his own benefit. Still, a significant minority of Americans, certainly a larger portion of the population than in most countries, take seriously a citizen's duty to understand our democracy. Since October, more than 52,000 undocumented children have been detained after fleeing crime, violence and poverty in their native countries including Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras,. "However, those who support immigration reform said that people fleeing violence and crippling poverty in their native countries should be treated with respect and dignity, not criminalized. <CN> How can you repatriate citizens of your own country? This is just ignorance.
<HS> We must send Islamics back to their native countries. They are too different from us. <knowl> Politicians have been sundered from the people they are supposed to represent. Otherwise, politicians can deal with public opinion in three ways: Ignore it, change it or pander to it. When asked whether extramarital sexual relations are always wrong, almost always wrong, wrong only sometimes or not wrong at all, public opinion is uniformly adamant. We do our activism online, signing petitions and emailing our politicians. This opinion has caused discomfort to the crew, which I regret. <CN> Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong.
<HS> The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult! <knowl> By modern standards, it feels somehow wrong to lump racists, athiests, and gay people into the same survey, as if they were comparable identities. According to a newly released longitudinal study of tolerance across generations, we're now more tolerant of every group except people who are intolerant. The caricature of Islam as a violent and intolerant religion is horrendously incomplete. Suppose Williams had said something hurtful to gay people instead of to Muslims. "adds, "How can ANYONE at the WWE say anything derogatory about gay people?? <CN> You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well.
<HS> The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult! <knowl> He began pushing hard for ever more Islamization and a potent mix of faith and xenophobia. Islam is a vast, complicated faith, no more monolithic than Christianity, and hard to draw generalizations about. He's talked about Islamic terror as an aberration that reformers within the faith can fight back against. The potential for intolerance lies in the logic of religions like Christianity and Islam that say their teaching derive from a divine revelation. <CN> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
<HS> The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult! <knowl> As the historian Richard Southern put it, Islam was Latin Christendom's greatest problem, a mighty military and cultural challenge, dazzling in its power, wealth, learning and civilisation. It's time for a frank discussion about our ally Saudi Arabia and its role legitimizing fundamentalism and intolerance in the Islamic world. Paris now offers the latest gruesome reminder of radical Islam's barbarism. Where is the Muslim world's outrage against these acts of terror and evil? Let's denounce terrorism, oppression and misogyny in the Islamic world — and everywhere else. <CN> The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but if someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned.
<HS> The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult! <knowl> And he thrust Islamization upon a country that had been a model of tolerance in the Muslim world. Of the bottom 10 countries in the World Economic Forum's gender gap report, I count nine as majority Muslim. It's time for a frank discussion about our ally Saudi Arabia and its role legitimizing fundamentalism and intolerance in the Islamic world. To be blunt, Saudi Arabia legitimizes Islamic extremism and intolerance around the world. Let's denounce terrorism, oppression and misogyny in the Islamic world — and everywhere else. <CN> My friend, this world is not perfect. It experienced world wars I and II, economic recession, political crisis, etc. Us is a Christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. Islam cannot explain all of these.
<HS> The UK and us must fight Islam! Islam is intolerance, Quran, jihad, being gay, barbarism and so on. It is a disgusting cult! <knowl> It blasted the publication of the cartoons as unacceptable incitement to religious hatred. Medieval Islamic thinkers inferred an earthly punishment by considering homosexuality as a form of adultery. Though intolerance may be as old as religion itself, we still see vigorous signs of its virulence. It's a variation on the old "you are intolerant if you refuse to tolerate my intolerance" argument. He's talked about Islamic terror as an aberration that reformers within the faith can fight back against. <CN> This is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred.
<HS> Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century. <knowl> The second one was "Money is at the root of all evil." Copyright 2000 Children's Express Foundation, Inc.Money, Money, Money Money makes the world go round, or is it the root of all evil? Still, Stollman said, it would be unfair to say that having money is the root of all marriage evil. To oversimplify a bit — but only, I think, a bit — the Sanders view is that money is the root of all evil. <CN> You make it sound like the 'Necromonicon'. Besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'?
<HS> Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century. <knowl> British scholars have suggested that fragments of the world's oldest known Quran, which were discovered last month, may predate the accepted founding date of Islam by the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Today, the Christian population has dwindled to fewer than 400,000 — and many are on the run from Islamic State. Muhammad's words are the basis for offensive Jihad - spreading Islam by force. <CN> I'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. Why do you blame Islam in all the problems?
<HS> Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century. <knowl> The Quran, he said, is already present in the minds of Muslims. It's not the wind tearing down thousands of year old buddhist shrines around the world. British scholars have suggested that fragments of the world's oldest known Quran, which were discovered last month, may predate the accepted founding date of Islam by the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Quran (2:244) - "Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things. <CN> My friend, like Quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. For example, The Bible and The Buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages.
<HS> Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century. <knowl> It's unclear how the change in statements from the key witnesses will affect her case. It's not the Quran they question, but how particular interpretations of it have hardened into truth. British scholars have suggested that fragments of the world's oldest known Quran, which were discovered last month, may predate the accepted founding date of Islam by the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan condemned it as "disrespectful, intolerant and divisive," in a statement on Wednesday. ""It's obviously a difficult verse," said Dakake, the only woman on the translation team of "The Study Quran. <CN> Have you read Qu'ran? Do you know what it states? I suppose not. How can you then judge the statements there?
<HS> Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century. <knowl> Governments, world leaders and others were responding Friday to a Florida pastor's plan to burn copies of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, even amid confusion over whether it would go ahead. President Barack Obama on Thursday said a Florida church's plans to burn dozens of Qurans this weekend would be a "recruitment bonanza" for al Qaeda. As early as the 8th century CE, high quality paper was being manufactured in Samarqand. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan condemned a Florida church's plan to burn the Quran, the Muslim holy book, as "disrespectful, intolerant and divisive," in a statement on Wednesday. British scholars have suggested that fragments of the world's oldest known Quran, which were discovered last month, may predate the accepted founding date of Islam by the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. <CN> Despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? Because I am struggling to figure this out.
<HS> Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century. <knowl> Why, they ask, should the way that 10th-century Baghdadi men read the Quran dictate the rights of a 21st-century woman? Over the centuries, the holy book became increasingly treated as an aesthetic object and a ritual instrument. It's not the Quran they question, but how particular interpretations of it have hardened into truth. British scholars have suggested that fragments of the world's oldest known Quran, which were discovered last month, may predate the accepted founding date of Islam by the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Their brief rule over Islam's holy sites in the early 19th century introduced pilgrims from across the world to the idea that violent revolution could be construed as a religious obligation. <CN> So what about other religious books? They do not belong to our century either?
<HS> Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century. <knowl> British scholars have suggested that fragments of the world's oldest known Quran, which were discovered last month, may predate the accepted founding date of Islam by the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. The prophet Mohammed's charter with Christians worldwide concludes, "We defend Christians. ... Islamic State's latest targets are the Assyrians, one of the world's oldest Christian communities, who are concentrated in northeastern Syria and northern Iraq. The 20th century has been a century of bloodshed and violence, he said. Muhammad's words are the basis for offensive Jihad - spreading Islam by force. <CN> Christian ideology is even more ancient than Islam, and Buddhism is even centuries older. Are you suggesting to ban all the religions? Or are you specifically picky about Islam?
<HS> Quran is the root of all the world's problems today. Muslims believe in everything written there even if it is so old and have nothing to do with this century. <knowl> The Quran, like all foundational religious texts, is a tangle of ambiguities and mysteries, to which endless annotations can be, and are being, written. Their brief rule over Islam's holy sites in the early 19th century introduced pilgrims from across the world to the idea that violent revolution could be construed as a religious obligation. It's important that Americans understand Islam does not condone violence or the imposition of religious beliefs. In Dearborn, where Arab-Americans account for more than 40% of the population and comprise a majority of the City Council, the burning of the Islam's key religious text has been met with confusion. The Wahhabi appropriation of Ibn Taymiyyah's teachings would have a profound impact on the future of Islamic militancy. <CN> Well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. So I strongly disagree with you on this one.
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> But both their records are devoid of pushing for Sharia law. Specifically, the courts shall not consider Sharia Law" or other international laws. Sharia is a system of law based on the tenets of Islam. Christie, typically blunt, dismissed the criticism: This 'Sharia law' business is crap. This also has as many definitions as the persons applying the Sharia law. <CN> Maybe it is not that they do not want to assimilate but they do not know our society and how to assimilate. If we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures.
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> Sharia law has been a part of islam since the beginning. But both their records are devoid of pushing for Sharia law. They don't implement the sharia in Saudi Arabia or in Iran. So Gingrich would be the United States' first officially ­anti-sharia president. Sharia law may be interpreted as the replication of seventh-century Medina. <CN> I do not share your opinion, but I do acknowledge that opinions, mine or yours, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. My 'experience' of Muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem.
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> As "Talking Points" stated last week most Muslims are peaceful people. Muslims are Muslim by religion and French, British, German, American by culture. Following Sharia slavishly throughout one's life was paramount to hurriyya "freedom." To others, it's a collection of religious principles that shift over time. Neither Kosher nor Sharia law has any place under America's Constitutional system. <CN> Every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only Muslim people. Secondly, I've never seen them demanding everyone's respect?
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> Those who approve sharia becoming the law of the land generally pray more than their Muslim brethren. My Muslim friends and family members don't want Sharia law, neither do the Muslim elected officials nor the biggest American-Muslim groups -- not even the people of Dearborn. Islamic financing, based on Sharia law, forbids Muslims from investing in projects where liquor or pork will be sold, for instance. But both their records are devoid of pushing for Sharia law. Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. <CN> Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it.
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> Politicians constantly call for a defense of British values against extremism. The addition of Sharia law to "the law of the land", in this case British law, complements, rather than undermines, existing legal frameworks. Freedom of Worship or Freedom to Worship is the second of the Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell . This in turn leads to them feeling excluded not just from the rights of British citizens, but also the obligations and standards of behaviour which go with being a full partner in British society. But they also throw light on the character of British society today. <CN> Doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all British Citizens have? Freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'British values'.
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> That Sharia law is monolithic set of law covering all Moslems is a myth. In those cases, Islamic law is treated like any other foreign law or Catholic canon law. First, the increased integration of Sharia law would merely sanction and improve upon what is already occurring: western Muslims practicing Sharia law without violating western law. The Holy Koran (Quran) verbatim as Law, Fundamentalist Islamic Shia (Sharia) Laws, Ancient Islamic Customs (Hadith) as Laws. Sharia law differs from country to country, and is a mixture of tribal law, ethnic customs and religious beliefs. <CN> No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> By the time of the Edmunds Act of 1882, polygamy was considered a felony compared to slavery. Suddenly, America's abuzz about "gold plates and magic underwear," says Terryl Givens, a professor of religion at the University of Richmond in Virginia and a Mormon himself. The polygamist sect has no affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (commonly known as the "Mormon" church). This is why Warren requires the Book of Mormon 1976 or older. "Atlanta criminal defense attorney Ken Driggs, who says he's a sixth-generation Mormon with two generations of polygamy, has written about Mormonism. <CN> Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons.
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> These principles are believed to be the foundation of the faith. But both their records are devoid of pushing for Sharia law. Almost all Muslim countries give precedence to secular law over sharia. So Gingrich would be the United States' first officially ­anti-sharia president. Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. <CN> Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> Sharia law is the reason women in Islamic countries can't drive. Talk-show host Mark Levin says, We already have creeping sharia law in this country. "Sharia law is the law which is used to behead women in Islamic countries who have been raped. Who decides how far into Sharia law you have to be? But both their records are devoid of pushing for Sharia law. <CN> Even if people follow Sharia Law, it does not mean that country has to accept it officially.
<HS> Muslims do not want to integrate, they want to impose sharia. And then they ask for respect! They are a problem! <knowl> Sharia law has been a part of islam since the beginning. But both their records are devoid of pushing for Sharia law. Almost all Muslim countries give precedence to secular law over sharia. Your source is Sarah Palin?Then implement Sharia on a turnip truck. There should NEVER be a sharia system set up in the USA. <CN> To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem?
<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> This is a human rights abuse and it has to stop, she says. Carrying out FGM on a minor has been illegal in the US under federal law since 1996, and 22 states have passed their own FGM laws. In February, Representative Joe Crowley and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee introduced the Zero Tolerance for FGM Act, which would see Washington following Britain by crafting a national anti-FGM strategy. It carries grave dangers to physical and mental health, and the US government considers it to be a serious human rights abuse and a form of gender-based violence, Meehan said. Similarly, Pope Francis voiced his support to end FGM on a trip to Africa in November. <CN> Fgm is a serious human rights abuse. If you really care about stopping it, I think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-Muslim rhetoric.
<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> The same now has to be true of those parents who allow FGM. FGM may place women at higher risk of problems during pregnancy and childbirth , which are more common with the more extensive FGM procedures . "Wherever communities [that practise FGM] are residing, it is a problem," she said. Although primarily concentrated in 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East, FGM is a global problem. From 1925 , beginning with the CSM mission , several missionary churches declared that FGM was prohibited for African Christians . <CN> Christians also practise FGM. It is not a uniquely Muslim problem.
<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> The same now has to be true of those parents who allow FGM. Infibulation, the more extreme version of FGM, involves the cutting away of genitalia. But just think of the girls her age - including many in this country - who know that these changes bring with them the agony and humiliation of FGM. Just imagine the impact if the most famous son of Africa became fully engaged on this issue. But that couldn't make me forget the estimated 6000 girls that are cut every day, or the suffering of the countless African female migrants in this country who are traumatized survivors of FGM. <CN> Fgm is not a Muslim-only issue. It is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion.
<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> A campaign against FGM is not a covert attack on Islam and no one should worry about "religious sensitivities". Jaha Dukureh was cut as a baby in her home country of the Gambia and is leading the campaign against FGM in the US. In most countries, the number of men and women against FGM are relatively balanced. "Words like 'sunna' and 'tahur' used for FGM by Muslims erroneously endorse the link of Islam to FGM and brings the great religion into disrepute. Despite the fact that FGM predates Islam and is not referred to in the Qur'an or practised by the majority of Muslims, the Gambia's Supreme Islamic Council maintains its support for the practice on religious grounds. <CN> Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one.
<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> FGM is a traditional practice prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. In fact, there has been a fatwa that bans FGM."Campaigners hope Sohair's case would discourage other doctors from continuing the practice. According to a survey by Unicef, an estimated 91% of married Egyptian women between 15 and 49 have undergone FGM, 72% by doctors. "Fahma, who has seen at firsthand among friends and family the devastation that FGM can cause, said that eradicating FGM in a generation was achievable. More than 140 million women and girls worldwide have suffered FGM, with up to 98% of girls mutilated in certain African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries. <CN> 26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British Asian and abhor FGM.

So, he submits, it can never be reasonable parenting to inflict any form of FGM on a child. <CN> Fgm is not a Muslim practice.

<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> The Luo's nearest neighbors, the Kisii tribe, practiced FGM and are still mutilating almost all their daughters. But FGM as a cultural practice is outweighed by the fact that it's an undebatable human rights violation. Some Muslims believe — misguidedly — that the Quran endorses the practice. While it's largely condemned around the world, social and cultural pressures to participate keep FGM a dark reality for many women. The discourse cannot be about fearing to challenge someone's religion or culture, but on the fundamental rights of girls as human beings. <CN> Fgm is not only practised by Muslims. It is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion.

At the age of seven, Nimco Ali flew back from Manchester, England, to her parents' home country of Djibouti. That's in part because of tough new laws due to be enacted on July 17 in Britain, where an estimated 20,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk of FGM every year. Sanctuary for Families provides victims of FGM, domestic violence, sex trafficking, and their children with a range of comprehensive services. <CN> The Muslim Council of Britain agrees that FGM is against Islamic teachings. Muslims disagree with FGM. Stop spreading negative stereotypes!

The pollster, Ipsos-Mori, does monthly surveys in 24 countries, three of which are majority Muslim - Turkey, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. <CN> Fgm is not widely practised in Muslim countries like Morocco, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan.

Taina Bien-Aimé, executive director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, and a longtime anti-FGM campaigner, said: These figures reflect the consequences of indifference to human rights violations against girls and African girls in particular. The same now has to be true of those parents who allow FGM. Infibulation, the more extreme version of FGM, involves the cutting away of genitalia. "Wherever communities [that practise FGM] are residing, it is a problem," she said. <CN> I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem.

But President Obama is also visiting a region of Africa with enormous problems and one in particular that receives sparse attention from his administration: female genital mutilation (FGM).

<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> Female genital mutilation is rooted in the cultures of some African countries and elsewhere, including Indonesia, Colombia and India.

"Determining the magnitude of female genital mutilation is essential to eliminating the practice," said Rao Gupta, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director. "While female genital mutilation is illegal in many countries, numerous communities consider the practice part of their cultural traditions and continue performing it. FGM is not fundamentally a religious issue, but a cultural one. <CN> Female Genital Mutilation occurs in non-Muslim societies (including Christian and Animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion.
<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> The conference listed FGM as a form of violence against women , marking it as a human - rights violation , rather than a medical issue . FGM may place women at higher risk of problems during pregnancy and childbirth , which are more common with the more extensive FGM procedures . In 2008 several United Nations bodies , including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , published a statement recognizing FGM as a human - rights violation . Eric Silverman writes that FGM has become one of anthropology 's central moral topics , raising difficult questions about cultural relativism , tolerance and the universality of human rights . Communities often refer to just two forms of FGM : pharaonic for infibulation and sunna for everything else . <CN> Fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from Islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it.
<HS> Fgm happens only to girls that have muslims parents! <knowl> Some Muslims believe — misguidedly — that the Quran endorses the practice. There is no endorsement of FGM in the Bible, the Tanakh or Quran. The same now has to be true of those parents who allow FGM.

Muslims in the US are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward LGBT people than Christians. Maybe we can all learn something from them?

As well,envirnomental factors of cultural are not a function of religion or religous doctrine, but the religous doctrine can be distorted by the culture. It's an acknowledgement that the religion and its teachings aren't enough to convince people to follow it. I am saying that, for President Bush, the entire religion of Islam was not synonymous with extremism and Muslims were not Nazis. There are many forms of Buddhist practice and culture, many Buddhist communities of belief and practice and significant doctrinal differences among Buddhist schools. <CN> The only thing that is ENOUGH is this discriminatory hate speech.

Concerning freedom of religion: Muslims are not free to choose their religion. So, for instance, I don't casually condemn or denigrate people's religions because I want people of faith to hear me. You need to study Islam before you decide that it is about freedom of religion. The rise of the Islamic State in the Middle East and the spread of extremism among disaffected Muslim youths around the world have led even some liberal people to condemn Islam itself as violent and intolerant. <CN> Have you ever truely understand the religion Islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? Islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. It is also what the majority of Muslims follow.
<HS> Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on. <knowl> Many people here point out certain Islamic practices found in many Islamic dominated countries in the world. But many people will not even admit this is about fringe Islam. The 9/11 terrorists did not just "come from an Islamic background", they killed 3,000 random people IN THE NAME of Islam. 11:10 AM Jul 28th via Twitter posted by Islamic Jihadi"Now what were you saying about the tolerance and non-violence of Islam?Posted by: shewholives | July 30, 2010 1:50 PMReport Offensive Commenthttp://www.thereligionof peace.com dissects Islam and shows how evil it is today. Assad should eliminate as many Sunni rebels Fundamentalist Islamic Holy Warriors of Islam as possible. <CN> What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blamed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?
<HS> Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on. <knowl> However, this is a fundamental perversion of free speech, to say the least. Assad should eliminate as many Sunni rebels Fundamentalist Islamic Holy Warriors of Islam as possible. The message was one of triumph, that Islam has now defeated you and Islam reigns supreme. The Nation of Origin does NOT determine Moderate Islamic Believers, nor Fundamentalist Islamic Believers, their Actions do. Al Qaeda's cause is not Islam — it is a gross distortion of Islam, he rightly said. <CN> Everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. Plus, based on what you critisize Islam? I recommend you to read something about true Islam and Muslims. You would find that they are no different from us.
<HS> Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on. <knowl> A war on Islam would make a war on terrorism impossible. Some invoked their alarm over Shariah law and others denigrated Islam as a cult. It would be an unprecedented act of sectarianism, alienating an entire faith tradition from the American experiment. In places where political Islam has crowded out alternative views, other faiths have found themselves under siege. She wonders: Must all who question Islam end up leaving the faith, as I did, or embracing violent jihad? <CN> How can you say such hateful things about an entire faith?
<HS> Islam is a cult (even if I couldn't say that) that leads us to war, in addition to that they are intolerant, biased,sexist and so on. <knowl> This monolithic, negative portrayal provides a skewed image of Islam and Muslims. But their bleak outlook on Islam and the Muslim lingers on unchanged. They depict Muslims and non-Muslims sharing how they define their personal struggles. The harshest critics of this cult are ex-Muslims and their books are proliferating. It also fits into a clear historic pattern of western perceptions of Islam and Muslims. <CN> You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Every year Muslims contribute over £31 billion to the UK economy. PMI data just out reveals that UK economy has deteriorated post Brexit. Second, the UK economy has returned to growth more strongly than most expected. With every major global economic body agreeing on the threat of Brexit to the UK economy, it is hard to take his views seriously. Image: U. Baumgarten via Getty ImagesEveryone thought Brexit would spell doom for the UK economy. <CN> This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> There is no equivalent of the chief rabbi or archbishop of Canterbury for Muslims, and silence can be misconstrued as an endorsement of extremism. About 8% of American marriages are now between partners of different races, and a much higher proportion, 37%, are between individuals of different religions. Theyre sort of in reactive mode. With a higher unemployment rate, the Fed could move to a neutral stance when it meets Dec. 19. "Omer El-Hamdoon, president of the Muslim Association of Britain, also backed the survey's findings. Though it has attracted only a minute proportion of Muslims, Wahhabism has been devastating in its impact. <CN> There is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white British- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of Muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> But a more important criticism of the education that many Muslims children receive may be that it is just not very good. Unemployment is lower among Israeli Christians than among Muslims, and life expectancy is higher. In 2001, just 33 per cent of British Muslims lived in Britain's poorest places. Probably the most important reason for lack of equality of opportunity is education: both its quantity and quality. But this is all part and parcel of the experience, and most Muslims take it in their stride. <CN> Muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white British unemployment. The problem is not Muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> A quick Google search shows that the images of the incident are still readily available. A quick Google search of Starbucks and Christmas now still returns 26.5 million results, underscoring just how... Not only can you see his opinions and whereabouts with a quick Google search, he can also see yours. Constant ContactGmail, Gchat, and Google+ Hangouts let us communicate with the people in our lives all the time, which can be both good and bad. Nevins & Associates agreed to help scrub records of the incident from Google search results and consult with the schools chancellor on brand enhancement, according to the report. <CN> Let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. Please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Whatever status women have in the Muslim world is whatever status men give them. Many followers of Islam claim that the Quran forbids interfaith marriage for Muslim women while sanctioning it for Muslim men. Muslim women in Sudan are further prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, although Muslim men are permitted to marry outside their faith. Christian men cannot marry Muslim women in Egypt unless they convert to Islam first, but Muslim men can marry Christian women. Women's terms in Muslim societies is for most women survival and resignation. <CN> Dwp says 11% of Muslim men and 16% of Muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. Why bother making up things?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Through clenched teeth, he ranted that Muslim men are rapists and terrorists, and that Muslim women are victims of their own oppression. In addition, the same survey showed many more Muslim men (70%) than Muslim women (54%) think marrying a non-Muslim is acceptable. Muslim men were routinely tortured next door to where the women were raped and killed. As a result, Muslim men, too, may be reluctant to be cared for by female physicians. Because female sexuality isn't as accessible in the Muslim world, men in these parts are more likely to pursue Muslim women on the women's terms. <CN> Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> You are comparing a specialised academic institution to an arbitrarily chosen group of people. There simply isn't any place for slandering an entire religious group in public life, let alone from the mouth of a presidential aspirant. Under the Criminal Code of Canada, a hate crime is committed to intimidate, harm or terrify an entire group of people to which the victim belongs. Viewing a group of people as aliens because of their faith is against everything America stands for. The way of life here in the U.S. has now been discredited, and it cannot be defended. <CN> How can you say this about an entire group of people from all walks of life?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> "Muslim claims of religious discrimination at work peaked in the year after the 9/11 attacks. Broadcasting prejudicial and discriminatory behavior, for example, might help reduce discrimination. "People get attacked and beaten for doing nothing but appearing Muslim. The opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has, at times, used anti-Muslim sentiment to court votes while pledging to keep Hindu heritage alive. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for instance Muslim complaints of religious discrimination have risen to record levels: 58.4 percent over claims from 2004 (religious discrimination charges for that same time period increased overall by 44 percent). <CN> According to the Sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for Muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not P-T work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Mursaleen, of British Muslim organisation Minhaj-ul-Quran UK, said of the poll: "I agree with the result, which was expected. In 2001, just 33 per cent of British Muslims lived in Britain's poorest places. Pickles was accused of treating Muslims as in some way apart from the rest of British society. Meanwhile, some 21.3 per cent of British Muslims have never worked, a figure that excludes full-time students. Breakthrough also privately says that one objective of its Ricu work is to promote a reconciled British Muslim identity. <CN> Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Job applicant Samantha Elauf did not tell her interviewer she was Muslim. Contact your state legislators and ask them to support a national law that prohibits questions about an applicant's marital or family status during job interviews. <CN> Job applicants with non-Muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with Muslim names. Remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> He's typical of the vast majority of suburban business owners across Iraq. Most state unemployment insurance programs cover the first 26 weeks, or six months, of unemployment, normally enough time for the vast majority of unemployed to find new work. The largest group of American Muslims is actually African American Muslims, the vast majority of whom follow Sunni Islam. French Council of the Muslim Faith head Dalil Boubakeur, who attended the ceremony, affirmed that the vast majority of French Muslims are not anti-Semitic. The vast, vast majority of Muslims in this country and around the world are moderates. <CN> If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?

<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Every year Muslims contribute over £31 billion to the UK economy. In fact, the American Muslim community is the most diverse Muslim community in the world. Othman and other Muslim leaders blamed Muslims for the attacks but also say they weren't sectarian. Having hardly any credible Muslim voices within the GOP makes it hard for them to support Muslim Americans. Today Srebrenica's population, which was 75 percent Muslim before the war, is evenly split between Serbs and Muslims. <CN> That is not what I observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> More than two dozen recently signed a letter saying they would refuse all PBA work as a result of Lynch's actions. The bullying often works to silence critics of Islamic extremism. ... Something else is also at work, and it needs to be discussed. People want to work and they want to participate in the community. The union claims that de Blasio is refusing to support fair pay for cops. <CN> If they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. So what is your problem?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> This is seen as "proof" that Jews or Israel must have been behind the attacks. Furnish the proof, so that educated Muslims can expose the fraudulent use of our faith. The document does not offer any proof that IS actually engages in organ harvesting or organ trafficking. I will respond the way the Quran instructs me to: by asking for proof of their claim. They see it as proof that the Republican presidential front-runner could better contain extremists than other candidates. <CN> How do you know this? Do you have any proof, official papers?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Legislation on racial discrimination has itself been discriminatory against Muslims by protecting Jews and Sikhs but denying the same protection to Muslims," said Shadjareh. Why are the existing laws of the muslim countries so hateful towards the non-muslims? Non-muslims are treated as second class citizens and discrimination against the non-muslims is rampant. These are some of the unintended and intended omissions by the Muslim community, which contributes to weak bonds between American Muslims and America and makes Muslims weak citizens. Where ever the number of muslims have grown to a significant minority, problems for the non-muslims have multiplied. <CN> Discrimination by employers in Europe against Muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of Muslims in the workforce.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> The fall in pay, while acutest among lower skilled workers, has been registered in most parts of the labour market. The ILO have picked out certain labour market characteristics that explain why there is a split between what men and women earn, such as education, experience and location. Intuitively one would expect that with a growing economy and such high employment the government's tax receipts would be increasing at a pace with the labour market. We have shown that anti-Muslim discrimination on the French labor market is alive and well. "Beyond the loss of opportunities in the labor market and social life, experiences of discrimination are associated with a higher feeling of rejection from Frenchness and a sense of isolation. <CN> That might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Together with healthcare professionals, we help millions of people live better lives. We collaborate with healthcare professionals around the globe to advance the pace of innovation. Good morning and welcome to the daily live blog from the Guardian Healthcare Professionals Network. Thanks to seeking help, Soraja is currently under the care of healthcare professionals at eating disorder clinic. Prof Dawkins, of Oxford University, has argued there is no evidence of God's existence and recently claimed that devout Muslims were importing creationist "mythology" into the UK, with politically correct teachers afraid of challenging it. <CN> Muslims make up many important jobs in the UK, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Why are the existing laws of the muslim countries so hateful towards the non-muslims? Where ever the number of muslims have grown to a significant minority, problems for the non-muslims have multiplied. They depict Muslims and non-Muslims sharing how they define their personal struggles. They show that newly arrived immigrants almost never think of themselves as British and that no difference exists between Muslims and non-Muslims. Ramadan is our opportunity as Muslims and non-Muslims to truly integrate with one another. <CN> The proportion of Muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-Muslims (add a link to UK employment statistics).
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> These are all facts that are readily available on the web. There are thousands of other scientific facts in the Holy Quran. It rests also an ideological framework through which to interpret facts. In fact far more harm will happen if it IS built. Politics has always relied on more than just facts about the world. <CN> That is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> A top Muslim group said cases like this appear to be related to religion and are worrying for British Muslims. Earlier, a British Airways worker said she was sent home for refusing to conceal a small Christian cross while on duty. As former Bush administration official Elliot Abrams recently noted:The people who are doing these things view themselves as good Muslims. Again, we applaud the people of Boston who showed their true character by refusing to give in to terrorism at all. People who committed this heinous crime cannot be called Muslim, Hanif Nalkhande, a spokesman for the trust, told The Times of London. <CN> This is not true. Muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white British people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> "Ms Bruni was backing a petition calling for positive discrimination in favour of people from ethnic minorities. In 2013 alone it found that just over a quarter of these parts were played by people from ethnic minorities, despite 37% of the US population hailing from these groups. We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Racial discrimination is still rife within Victoria police, with some young people from ethnic minorities afraid to drive in certain areas of Melbourne for fear of being harassed, a study has found. "Maybe we represented thousands of young people from ethnic minorities, who left their hometowns to pursue a 'modern life' but chose to return to tradition after feeling a void in the heart," he said. <CN> Well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to White people. There's your cause of unemployment.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> We are Muslims, we live in America, I didn't teach my children to hate people, he said. Simply put, prejudice is not police work, and crime cannot be prevented by the mass stereotyping of entire communities. When we get this kind of casual stereotyping and bigoted comments towards American Muslims, in particular young people, it's very damaging. American Muslims' vote for Obama reflects a repudiation of President Bush and his administration's relentless stereotyping of Muslims as extremists and terrorists. Islam has a major problem on its hands, Mr. Rubio concluded, but we are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith. <CN> All Muslim people I know are employed and hard working individuals. Stereotyping much?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> In another seven London council areas, more than a quarter of all school-age children are from Muslim homes. Religious Tensions in Myanmar: In western Myanmar, Muslims and Buddhists clash. Previous surveys, for instance in 2006 and 2013, reached similar conclusions. Tower Hamlets in London tops the list with 34.5 per cent. The hatred we have for each other is growing day by day. <CN> Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> It employs around 1,200 members in various employment sectors, including catering, art curatorship and media relations. But Post 86 means you have after-tax contributions in your retirement account. Roth IRAs allow investors to make after-tax contributions and, generally, earnings grow tax-free. When the economy is struggling and jobs are hard to get, people give up job searches. The brief government shutdown in October and budget sequestration created some uncertainty in major employment sectors. <CN> Muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the UK's economy through their hard work and tax contributions.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> You would have had a totally different story -- would have been a different world. "Nobody ever heard of the guy."Kovaleski has said he stands by his original story. Every one of those people has a different voice ... a different perspective ... a different story to tell. Surely his front page isn't reserved for stories about Bad Muslims, with articles about Good Muslims going inside. The story of God through the prism of Islam seems to tell a very different story in the modern period. <CN> Where did you get your figures from? Because everywhere I look its a completely different story.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> The One Nation leader was holding a free forum on jobs and prosperity in Rockhampton today. Jobs became scarce everywhere, but scarcer especially for Muslims in les banlieues. In theory, one of the main achievements of French republicanism is equality. Many held under house arrest lost jobs or employment opportunities as a result. "Even more worryingly, most of the jobs getting lost are full-time jobs. <CN> Refuse to work do they? But at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. Tricky one that!
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Such talk infuriates Sweden's Muslim groups, who say that Ms. Sabuni is unfairly singling them out while avoiding pressing issues like unemployment. We profile packages from Yemen and likely from MOST Muslim countries. Oh, you know, basically implying that America is discriminating against Muslims. Obama has been absent from the Muslim community for many years. It becomes increasingly difficult to determine the race of a Muslim. <CN> If any Muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> In fact, the American Muslim community is the most diverse Muslim community in the world. She may make a few people think that Muslims can be heroes as well as villains. Muslims, like any other faith community, deserve to be Muslim, and celebrate their high holy holidays. "As Muslims are seen participating in a positive way in society, that really irritates some people. Reversing this campaign will require decades of work by Muslims and non-Muslims alike, but the endgame must be to render the ideology of Islamism intellectually and socially obsolete. <CN> How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> Any reference to not allowing pork products in school is incorrect. "Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible," Murdoch had tweeted, using an antiquated and politically incorrect spelling for Muslims. We have to speak out against it even when it becomes politically incorrect to do so. That's you presumption, and the incorrect one, as far as my worldwide experience clearly showing. Things that once were politically incorrect now seem to be not only acceptable and tolerated but even celebrated. <CN> Did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? Some Islamophobic tweets are so incorrect I do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them.
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> A half-dozen other rights groups, including the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers, have offered support to the Muslim group. Adnani's speech blames France and other Western countries for waging war against Muslims in general. On the other hand, majorities of Muslims in many countries — particularly Western countries — find these practices abhorrent. Yet others have emphasized instead that Muslims in France remain distinctive on a number of key integration measures. Gardee said the Canadian group only used the name because CAIR was well recognized within the Muslim civil liberties movement. <CN> Replace Muslim with any other group and can you see how false this statement is?
<HS> Almost all Muslims deliberately decide not to work. <knowl> The war being waged by the US/UK & co is a war against Islam & Muslims. "Mr Versi said research had shown that the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Britain would report suspicious activity. Many in the UK Muslim community had been hoping the aid convoy volunteer might be freed on the eve of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha. Could it be UK first to be attacked?They've attacked us with jets killing scores, plus they have many Muslims in prison as war on Islam. Worried about the rising number of Muslim children in our schools? <CN> Around 12% of Muslims in the UK are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics.
<HS> Anti-semitism cannot be eradicated: our country is full of anti-semitic muslims. All our work is useless. There are too many Islams! <knowl> The distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism has eroded, as many see Israeli action in terms of grand conspiracies. The new anti-Semitism can always say it is not the old anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism has become a catchall sentiment for many different groups of angry people. The long and ugly history of anti-Semitism has seen all too many episodes of apologists justifying hatred of the Jews. But neither should anti-Semitism be a moral shield for the justification of anti-Muslim prejudices. <CN> All forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered.

There are too many Islams! <knowl> Anti-Semitism has become a catchall sentiment for many different groups of angry people. But neither should anti-Semitism be a moral shield for the justification of anti-Muslim prejudices. For Julius, The Merchant of Venice is both an anti-Semitic play and a representation of anti-Semitism. The distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism has eroded, as many see Israeli action in terms of grand conspiracies. Many commentators talk of anti-Semitism as an almost wholly Muslim problem, and have used the growth of anti-Semitism to question the wisdom of allowing Muslim immigration to Europe. <CN> Sociological research shows that Western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. Thus, we cannot say that Muslims prevent the white people from getting the position.
<HS> Anti-semitism cannot be eradicated: our country is full of anti-semitic muslims. All our work is useless. There are too many Islams! <knowl> Leftist anti-Semites, neo-Nazi anti-Semites, old fashioned Christian anti-Semites, and, of course Arab and Islamic anti-Semites share common cause in their demonization of Israel. Through digital technology, anti-Semites find validation from and communion with anti-Semites elsewhere in their own countries and around the world. Long before Trump hit the scene, children were hurting each other with anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Sikh, and anti-Hindu statements or references. It holds that Anti-Semitism, anti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionism and other forms of discrimination have no place at the University of California. In fact, it is in those countries with fewer Muslims that anti-Semitism seems most prevalent. <CN> Dear friend, do not you think anti-Muslim is another version of anti-Semitic? I suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all.

Many commentators talk of anti-Semitism as an almost wholly Muslim problem, and have used the growth of anti-Semitism to question the wisdom of allowing Muslim immigration to Europe. Dreyfus was eventually exonerated, but the period was marked by anti-Semitic riots and a vocal anti-Semitic press—as well as by equally vocal non-Jewish defenders of Dreyfus. <CN> It is funny how lots of Jewish and Muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example)

Anti-Semitism has become a catchall sentiment for many different groups of angry people. <CN> Do you know that anti-Islamism is actually a form of anti-Semitism? It is equally wrong to hate Jews and Muslims.
<HS> Muslims steal the work of our citizens. I do not care if they have more skills, it is not right! First we and then them! <knowl> More work remains to be done to see just how psychological and social skills help encourage people to vote — and I'm actively involved in research trying to do so. The Brussels attacks last week killed more than 30 people and struck at the heart of NATO. Things like grit or tenacity, empathy, efficacy (believing in yourself), self-control, and social skills all matter immensely. It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. But in the meantime it remains so much more comfortable to blame the only people we're kidding. <CN> First of all, how do you know that this is true? Any valid sources prove it? Because it sounds like nonsense. Second of all, I do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be.
<HS> Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work. <knowl> "The entire city will be affected- tourism workers, shop owners, taxi drivers," Waleed Mohamed, 38, a taxi driver, said. Sooner or later taxi drivers will be fretting over self-driving cars. Unifor bused in taxi drivers from across Ontario and Quebec for the protest. There were some reports he had a fight with fellow taxi drivers yesterday. An UberPop vehicle overturned by French taxi drivers as they clash with riot police. <CN> So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. That I've encountered must be part of that 1% then?
<HS> Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work. <knowl> If Muslims go anywhere in the world to defend their brethren, this is a good thing. "Muslims can practise their faith openly in the UK and many people are thankful for that. Ajmal Masroor, from the Islamic Society of Britain, said: "Muslim communities are very loyal to this country. Muslims are portrayed, intentionally or not, as devious and violent more often than they are portrayed as lazy or dumb. At the same time, Muslims and Muslim-Americans were perceived as more hardworking than lazy and as more intelligent than unintelligent. <CN> Do you actually expect people to believe a fact THIS fake? At least try and think of a believable percentage.
<HS> Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work. <knowl> A majority of the victims appeared to be Muslims, either Turks or visitors from Muslim countries. "Police told CNN's French affiliate BFMTV that 2,800 taxi drivers were protesting across the country. "The entire city will be affected- tourism workers, shop owners, taxi drivers," Waleed Mohamed, 38, a taxi driver, said. This angered France's taxi drivers, who were being undercut, and Uber suspended uberPOP in the country last week after riots. first driver sped away as taxi drivers approached us loading his cab. <CN> So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!
<HS> Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work. <knowl> Muslims get blamed for terrorism even though the vast majority of us aren't terrorists. What Graugaard wants is to make sure teens possess the necessary skills to view porn constructively. Muslims are portrayed, intentionally or not, as devious and violent more often than they are portrayed as lazy or dumb. At the same time, Muslims and Muslim-Americans were perceived as more hardworking than lazy and as more intelligent than unintelligent. Worried about the rising number of Muslim children in our schools? <CN> The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest checking your sources?
<HS> Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work. <knowl> The suspects include doctors, teachers, scout leaders, care workers and former police officers. Obama leads 51%-43% among those classified as "professionals," including lawyers, doctors, scientists, teachers, engineers, nurses and accountants. Their answers are coded into one of the 11 categories that the U.S. federal government uses to classify workers. Bottom line: Despite the lagging economy, there are jobs available across all categories, whether from industry growth, skilled worker shortages or turnover. Mapping the figures show that many regional areas are in a similar situation to Mackay, with doctors or nurses the most common 457 category. <CN> So all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? I do not think so!
<HS> Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work. <knowl> According to Home Office statistics, 40 percent of asylum seekers spend more than a month in detention. Orban had painted his hard-line approach to the mostly Muslim asylum-seekers as a stand to preserve Europe as a Christian continent. Asylum seekers will be given 72 hours warning prior to deportation. "Asylum seekers are blamed for our problems in Europe and Germany. Unfortunately, Australians come to the asylum seeker debate burdened by historical myths. <CN> If we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed.
<HS> Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work. <knowl> The rise in the Muslim population, especially because of a high birth rate, means that Muslim clusters are getting bigger. The results of the survey  published today  shatter the myth that Muslims are not patriotic. "Muslims can practise their faith openly in the UK and many people are thankful for that. Last year, the Office of National Statistics released the list of the highest-paid jobs in the UK. But again, the distribution of that population is what counts, and Muslim children are often concentrated in particular areas. <CN> 100% of the unemployed Muslim stats I read on Twitter are fake. Muslim unemployment is at 12% in the UK, and many of that number are actively seeking work.
<HS> Statistics say that 99% of muslims in the uk are so lazy that they do not want to work. <knowl> Muslims are portrayed, intentionally or not, as devious and violent more often than they are portrayed as lazy or dumb. At the same time, Muslims and Muslim-Americans were perceived as more hardworking than lazy and as more intelligent than unintelligent. The video features Leonard Nimoy , who " enjoys the lazy life " . Worried about the rising number of Muslim children in our schools? We know that in many other countries Muslims have it worse. <CN> Where did you get this figure from? Might I get some real evidence for this? Because this seems very much unrealistic.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> In a statement Sunday, the rights group said the practice was a cruel punishment that amounts to torture. But the Galbraiths may not be alone: at least one other mom said her son faced the same cruel punishment. It is believed not to be in response to a specific threat, more to head off danger considering his moderate tone. Every violent group in history describes its own violence as the legitimate response to a threat that was forced on them. Albert survived the extreme and cruel punishment of 40-plus years in solitary confinement only because of his extraordinary strength and character. <CN> That sounds like quite a threat. Remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here?
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> The UK condemns the use of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment in all circumstances, a spokesman said. In a statement Sunday, the rights group said the practice was a cruel punishment that amounts to torture. Britain's Foreign Office said: The UK condemns the use of cruel and degrading punishment in all circumstances. But the Galbraiths may not be alone: at least one other mom said her son faced the same cruel punishment. The practice of using stocks has been cited as an example of torture and cruel punishment throughout the medieval, Renaissance or colonial American times. <CN> I do not think Muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. It is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> Criticism regarding Metta World Peace falling to distractions misses the point. It presupposes that Kelly needs defending because she can't defend herself. And Brown has moved Metta World Peace out of the starting lineup. World Peace, formerly Ron Artest, will slide into Odom's role as the top reserve. In 1992, Menchu was awarded the Nobel peace prize for her work defending indigenous peoples around the world. <CN> 1000s of Muslims died in WW1 and 2 defending Britain, 1000s still in UK armed forces defending peace across the world. Bloody retribution on them, really?
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> "Doctors and nurses don't just save lives - they do so much more. Doctors and nurses are trained differently, and our sense of priorities can conflict. These supervisors' message is clear: They value doctors more than nurses and treat them accordingly. Sirleaf on Saturday toured health centers in Monrovia, taking group photos with doctors and nurses. But their comments reflect widespread misunderstanding and, in some cases, disrespect, of what exactly nurses do. <CN> Quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict)
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> Mehdi Hasan, a prominent Muslim commentator, wrote recently of the relentless hostility towards Muslims. This exodus to Syria has led non-Muslims to point an accusing finger at Muslim communities. At the same time, Muslim activists say that anti-Muslim attacks have skyrocketed in recent years. All this might suggest a nation polarized between alienated Muslims and non-Muslims hostile to Islam. Britain's Foreign Office said: The UK condemns the use of cruel and degrading punishment in all circumstances. <CN> Not sure what you mean about Muslim's having won, when over 400,000 Muslims fought and died voluntarily for Britain in WW1, anyone would think they have always been on our side.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> The UK condemns the use of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment in all circumstances, a spokesman said. In a statement Sunday, the rights group said the practice was a cruel punishment that amounts to torture. But the Galbraiths may not be alone: at least one other mom said her son faced the same cruel punishment. The practice of using stocks has been cited as an example of torture and cruel punishment throughout the medieval, Renaissance or colonial American times. That would be a particularly cruel punishment for what is already proving to be one of the most unforgiving rowing regattas in Olympic history. <CN> That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or?
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> With this in mind, Islamophobic rhetoric is harmful and unhelpful, Ansari wrote. His case resumes on Monday, with the government reportedly seeking an even harsher sentence. The flames have been also been fanned by the Islamophobic rhetoric of the National Front. There seems to be no bottom to the cesspool of Islamophobic rhetoric coming from Republican candidates. The commission is seeking to address a longstanding criticism of ratings firms: that they have a conflict ... <CN> What are they trying to win? Muslims in the UK aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is Islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> That would be a particularly cruel punishment for what is already proving to be one of the most unforgiving rowing regattas in Olympic history. In a statement Sunday, the rights group said the practice was a cruel punishment that amounts to torture. But the Galbraiths may not be alone: at least one other mom said her son faced the same cruel punishment. Only a tiny minority has resettled in the West, with U.N. officials saying preference is given to the most vulnerable. Last year a United Nations report on human rights in Iran expressed concern that gays face harassment, persecution, cruel punishment and even the death penalty. <CN> Bloody retribution? Most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. But I do not think any of you are winning.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> Britain is safer, stronger and better off in a reformed EU, he insisted. On June 23rd, you will decide if Britain is stronger, safer and better off in a reformed EU. Britain's Foreign Office said: The UK condemns the use of cruel and degrading punishment in all circumstances. That leaflet appeared only to refer to Britain Stronger in Europe by its initials BSIE on the return address. Britain Stronger in Europe can't even be consistent or honest in their campaign to do down the British economy. <CN> Didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of Muslim doctors] seems like they're making Britain stronger.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> "Anti-Muslim violence and discrimination have been steadily increasing in France over the past few years. Comprehensive data on the effect of discrimination and hate crimes targeting Muslim women are hard to find. The law adopted last year enables people to file anti-discrimination lawsuits and adds hate-crime sentences for violent crimes. Victorian Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Greeks, Africans - even white anglo-Australians - say the Racial Discrimination Act must be strengthened, not weakened. Marches like this needs to be banned by the government and everyone should stand united against the discrimination, racism and hate. <CN> The only thing Muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> Let's see if it doesn't help us enormously in trying to decode the thing. Foolishly, I had tried to read the thing in German since I was also taking German. The UK condemns the use of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment in all circumstances, a spokesman said. I was second-guessing myself, thinking 'I'm just not normal,' and I'm trying to figure thing out. But the Galbraiths may not be alone: at least one other mom said her son faced the same cruel punishment. <CN> It's not an us and them thing. We are all just trying to get on and make a living. You do not do that by putting anyone down.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> In the Renaissance the practice of painting would have been a much bigger thing. After a certain point, and a limited amount of revision, the painting can only die. The least convincing picture here is a celeb- and logo-free view of D.C. monuments. My paintings either start as images I have seen in photographs or things that I have photographed. In a statement Sunday, the rights group said the practice was a cruel punishment that amounts to torture. <CN> Have won at what? The only thing I see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of Muslim originated threat.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> You cannot brutalize fellow human beings in any way and prosper. Which is a tragedy if it's happening to fellow human beings. For many species, even some humans, cockroaches are also a sought-after snack. A human will usually be killed outright by a dose of 10 Grays. One batch of his beetle eggs turned out to be contaminated with cockroach eggs. <CN> Good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. Cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term.
<HS> These despicable Muslims hadn't won yet. Now there will be a cruel punishment! <knowl> The human eye has a blind spot, though few of us realize it. After his eye surgery, Hisho was left blind, so Zen became his guide. At age 32, his other eye was affected by the condition, leaving him blind. He services poor people in the developing world who have developed cataracts — a clouding of the lens of the eye that is the world's leading cause of blindness. The world's only bionic eyes -- implants that can bring sight to the blind -- keep getting better. <CN> Bloody retribution? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind!
<HS> Muslims have privileges that we do not have. <knowl> This exodus to Syria has led non-Muslims to point an accusing finger at Muslim communities. But the real push for Shari'a is coming from Muslim intellects, clerics and leaders of Muslim organisations. "People get attacked and beaten for doing nothing but appearing Muslim. It can be anything from a spike in hate crimes to people viewing Muslims as less than fully American because of our faith. Figures from the Metropolitan Police in 2014 indicated that hate crimes against Muslims had risen by 65 percent in the previous 12 months. <CN> Yes, as well as everything non-Muslims aren't allowed to do by law, Muslims also have to put up with hateful bigotry and prejudice from people like you.
<HS> Muslims have privileges that we do not have. <knowl> The agreement would offer Serbia trade privileges and closer political ties. But you wouldn't know any of this from listening to some politicians. And when it comes to those admitting privileges so popular among anti-choice politicians and the advocates who back them, Parker notes that less than 1% of abortion care even necessitates hospital care. Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and now Louisiana and Oklahoma all passed similar measures centered on admitting privileges. Islamization begins when there are sufficient Muslims in a country to agitate for their religious privileges. <CN> Nah, I think that is too much effort for our politicians.
<HS> Muslims have privileges that we do not have. <knowl> He worries comments from candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz about Muslims could make things worse. Worried about the rising number of Muslim children in our schools? After my Sunday column criticizing comments by Martin Peretz about Muslims, he today issued an apology. Generalizing about Muslims is as impossible as it would be to generalize about Quakers and Don Rumsfeld. France granted citizenship, with all its privileges, to Algeria's Jews, but not to most of its Muslims. <CN> If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims).
<HS> Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam. <knowl> Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the recent violent protests, but said Western nations need to prevent insults to Islam. Our national conversation about Islam is focused on the wrong issues. This is normative Islam, adhered to by a billion normal Muslims across the globe. There is no consistent data over time about Americans' views on Islam or Muslims. In the United States, there is enormous suspicion of Islam and the Muslim faith. <CN> No because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity.
<HS> Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam. <knowl> Every year Muslims contribute over £31 billion to the UK economy. Ultimately, what happens among Western Muslims will define our ongoing struggle against Islamist terrorism. The Association of Muslim Schools says there are a total 156 dedicated Muslim schools in the UK, most of them privately-funded. But as in a number of other Western European nations, there is anxiety over the potential radicalization of a minority of Muslims. First, the increased integration of Sharia law would merely sanction and improve upon what is already occurring: western Muslims practicing Sharia law without violating western law. <CN> British Muslims contribute 31 billion to the UK economy and you'd call that a threat?
<HS> Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam. <knowl> Little did she know, the real threat was in her own family. It's a very real threat, but we can't say when exactly. Iran's nuclear ambition is a real threat; it needs to be corralled. It is an important reminder of the very real threat that radical Islam continues to pose to the homeland. Religion, a medieval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms, Rushie wrote. <CN> I'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this.
<HS> Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam. <knowl> It also fits into a clear historic pattern of western perceptions of Islam and Muslims. No western essence is there to stop a New Yorker of any ancestry taking up Islam. As the 2012 presidential election approaches, it has been difficult for me to listen to the political scapegoating of Muslims and those perceived to be Muslims. Living in the west, however you define it, being western, provides no guarantee that you will care about western civilisation. So will calls for the defence of "civilisation", with its overtones of Samuel Huntington's poisonous theories of post-cold war confrontation between the west and Islam, heightening perceptions of racism and hypocrisy. <CN> Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.
<HS> Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam. <knowl> So the classical traditions that are meant to distinguish western civilisation from the inheritors of the caliphates are actually a point of kinship with them. And yet from a historical point of view the study of Islam and its founder is problematic. National news coverage of Zealot has ignored this conflict of interest. I think that will lead to a changed picture of Islam. Let's hope reporters in future interviews will, being informed, mention the glaring conflict of interest in this Islamic opinion of Jesus. <CN> Do you think maybe the media paints this picture of Islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? Climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind.
<HS> Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam. <knowl> Geller, meanwhile, defended herself against claims she demonizes an entire religion and fuels anti-Islamic bigotry. Donald Trump accused Islam of hating the western world in an interview Wednesday, the latest in the GOP Presidential candidate's attacks on the religion. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten called the rally "unnecessary"."Australia is a diverse country and I don't believe in fomenting religious paranoia or hatred," Mr Shorten said today. Jihadists have too often deformed a great religion with insufficient rebuke. But I can still raise my voice against words of hatred. <CN> A much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions.
<HS> Our western civilisation risks to be destroyed by islam. <knowl> Every year Muslims contribute over £31 billion to the UK economy. The Association of Muslim Schools says there are a total 156 dedicated Muslim schools in the UK, most of them privately-funded. But as in a number of other Western European nations, there is anxiety over the potential radicalization of a minority of Muslims. Blair also said that the controversyÂ over the veil highlighted the difficulties faced byÂ British Muslims trying to balance their loyalty to their stateÂ and to their religion. Worried about the rising number of Muslim children in our schools? <CN> Oh, the 95% of British Muslims who feel loyalty to the UK? Sounds terrifying!
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> One reason for the confusions western culture spawns comes from confusions about the west. Talk of western culture has had a larger implausibility to overcome. 3. The Muslims are violent, intolerant animals that offend western values. This new attention to religion is, at its base, predominantly about Islam. They simply got closer to their religion, immersing themselves in Islamic scripture. <CN> Have you thought about what western value is what Islam is really about?
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> One reason for the confusions western culture spawns comes from confusions about the west. How could anyone in a western culture even imply that shariah law is in any way compatible with western beliefs. But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. Talk of western culture has had a larger implausibility to overcome. It imagines western culture as the expression of an essence - a something - which has been passed from hand to hand on its historic journey. <CN> What exactly is the West going to 'win'? Muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing division.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> This is an excellent time for the western world to demonstrate how a tolerant society functions. How could anyone in a western culture even imply that shariah law is in any way compatible with western beliefs. All religions seem to be opposed to the truly open society. This is a Christian country and no other religions will be tolerated. <CN> I thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. Hate and prejudice does not belong in western society.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> One reason for the confusions western culture spawns comes from confusions about the west. I'd say religion today (christianity, islam and judaism in particular) seem to be the methamphetamine of the people. Imagine the news in the world Death of Muslim babies by infidels. In some places, like Malaysia and Indonesia, the countries are not entirely Muslim. <CN> Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> This antiâWest pathology shows up in Westerners' hatred for the European Crusades in the Medieval Age. The emailer did not look inwardly, as if his own culture and religion may play a role. Religion, economy, and political controlFred M. Donner, the dean of historians specializing in the early Islamic conquests, cites three large factors for the Islamic Crusades. And the introduction of Israel into the picture, a country founded by immigrants from the West, made the new latter-day "memory" of the Crusades even more toxic. You can preach to me the loving peace of this religion. <CN> Let's do the Timewarp again! Let's not re-run the Crusades. It did not end well last time.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> How could anyone in a western culture even imply that shariah law is in any way compatible with western beliefs. "Oriental societies" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. Ghannoushi is currently writing a book on Western Representations of Islam Past and Present. If every standard by which the West is judged and condemned (slavery, imperialism, intolerance, misogyny, sexual repression, warfare...) were applied equally to Islam, the verdict would be devastating. <CN> Islam does belong in our multicultural Western society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> Concerning freedom of religion: Muslims are not free to choose their religion. The First Amendment proscribes establishment of religion, but clearly leaves room for schools to teach about religion. Scholars and advocacy networks model relations between religion and democracy, religion and peacebuilding, and religion and economic growth. How could anyone in a western culture even imply that shariah law is in any way compatible with western beliefs. When there aren't any people of any other religion left alive, devotees the religion of peace turns on its own. <CN> I'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century Western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> One reason for the confusions western culture spawns comes from confusions about the west. How could anyone in a western culture even imply that shariah law is in any way compatible with western beliefs. Talk of western culture has had a larger implausibility to overcome. But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. Islam is not only a religion but a political way of life. <CN> The only obstacle to Islam coexisting with Western culture is intolerance like this.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> One reason for the confusions western culture spawns comes from confusions about the west. Culture - like religion and nation and race - provides a source of identity for contemporary human beings. But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. Those things are the main source of the fear of islam. Talk of western culture has had a larger implausibility to overcome. <CN> Who said that West and Islam are competing at all? Is there a war? I do not like this way of seeing things. We should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> One reason for the confusions western culture spawns comes from confusions about the west. Western culture was, at its core, individualistic and democratic and liberty-minded and tolerant and progressive and rational and scientific. Talk of western culture has had a larger implausibility to overcome. This is a Christian country and no other religions will be tolerated. And yet the move from Christendom to western culture isn't straightforward. <CN> Unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. Concerning freedom of religion: Muslims are not free to choose their religion. Ultimately, what happens among Western Muslims will define our ongoing struggle against Islamist terrorism. Why should Western leaders or media outlets refrain from saying anything Muslims may find offensive? It also fits into a clear historic pattern of western perceptions of Islam and Muslims. <CN> The media scapegoats Muslims and encourages division. When will YOU wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising Muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> One reason for the confusions western culture spawns comes from confusions about the west. How could anyone in a western culture even imply that shariah law is in any way compatible with western beliefs. Talk of western culture has had a larger implausibility to overcome. But some Westerners see the threat from terrorists who are driven by ideology and politics as a threat from a culture and religion. And yet the move from Christendom to western culture isn't straightforward. <CN> Islam has given many things to the Western society. For example, medicine, mathematics. These things belong with our society. It is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture.
<HS> Islam has nothing to do with western culture and as soon as the west will understand, this religion will be defeated. <knowl> How could anyone in a western culture even imply that shariah law is in any way compatible with western beliefs. One reason for the confusions western culture spawns comes from confusions about the west. The West continues to brag about its culture of freedom of expression and uses it as an excuse to mock Islam. Those things are the main source of the fear of islam. There still at it today with their slavish adoration of Islam. <CN> I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
<HS> If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance! <knowl> Sufism's way of life, teachings of tolerance, wide understanding, unconditional love of mankind and total rejection of violence made me convert. My search for the right way of life actually started in the Catholic college I attended in Seville, she said. Quoting Bonhoeffer, Silence in the face of evil is itself evil. He asked for a moment of silence for the victims of a gun rampage early Sunday at a music festival in western Austria. But what struck me most was the credulousness and vulnerability of this young man who was so prey to manipulation by hate-mongers. <CN> Raise your voice in celebration! They bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers.
<HS> If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance! <knowl> Attendees bow their heads during a moment of silence in honor of... Tucked into these acres are three Towers of Silence where Parsis have for centuries disposed of their dead. But now I have an even better idea of the kind of people who you are at Mashable. Patricia Devine, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, noted 80% to 90% of white people show this bias. "Assassinations, intimidation, and looting of equipment are part of efforts to silence the private media," Abdirahman Omar Osman said. <CN> Or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you.
<HS> If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance! <knowl> He said Such is the way of Allah, He creates what He pleases. He would say: Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. <CN> Christianity and Islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to God / Allah what are you preaching?
<HS> If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance! <knowl> These demands are a way of imposing Islam on a secular society. "If anyone understands the issues of that minority voice it is Nawaz. "He was not that involved with the local Muslim community," Ubaid said. PARTISANSHIP: 49% of Muslim-Americans called themselves Democrats, 8% Republican and 37% independent. No one of the Muslims is to disobey this covenant until the Last Day. <CN> There is nothing to raise your voice to. Have you ever spoken to your local Muslim community?
<HS> If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance! <knowl> These demands are a way of imposing Islam on a secular society. Nevertheless, some expressions went way beyond the bounds of mainstream Islamic teachings. It is the way the prophet was depicted -- a man of great violence. I prefer weapons, because this way, I have the best of both worlds. There are acceptable ways of handling it: protesting, writing letters to the editor, boycotting. <CN> You are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it.
<HS> If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance! <knowl> Culture of tolerance: There is a culture of tolerance by silence for fundamentalist views in Islam. Also, after centuries of tolerance for satire of Christianity, opportunities for cleverness or originality are few and far between. Put another way, no American would want anyone to think that the Westboro Baptist Church spoke for all of Christianity. Blasphemy in the history of IslamAsad highlighted the big difference between the notion of talking against the religion in Christianity and Islam. Their understanding of Islam comes from what they are taught by others. <CN> After tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! Christianity and Islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about.
<HS> If we do not stand up against Islam they will consider our silence as a way of acceptance! <knowl> The West is in a war of ideas against political Islam. Mashable's cowardly act of censorship by attempting to silence another citizen's voice from speaking out loudly against the evils of radical Islam is shocking. The bullying often works to silence critics of Islamic extremism. ... Third, there are the efforts of countries in the Organization of the Islamic Conference to silence the European debate about Islam. There is no place for extremism of any kind in Islam. <CN> Islam - Silence is tacit acceptance. Raise your voice against Islamophobia!
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> And describing an entire religious group as potentially dangerous isn't especially helpful. His false claims, like the ludicrous idea that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated 9/11, are extremely dangerous. At the rally in Melbourne, numbers grew as members of a splinter group known as the United Patriots Front joined their extreme right-wing allies. The first group — the Islamist zealots — poses a threat to everyone. Vilifying entire groups just exacerbates the problem while playing to the haters. <CN> That sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one?
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> This is what religion looks like for the vast majority of Muslims. Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric and threatening to bans Muslim immigration or engage in special surveillance of Muslims "hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. His hateful ideology and targeting of innocent civilians has been rejected by the vast majority of Muslims and people of all faiths. Obviously, the vast majority of Muslims would never do anything like this, said Maher. The vast, vast majority of Muslims in this country and around the world are moderates. <CN> Don't believe biased media coverage about all Muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of Muslims condemn these people. The world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? the phrase somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds raises a vital question. A "lone wolf" can devise his or her evil plan in secret, making detection almost impossible. "Like Fleming's bad guys, he has resources, he's clever and has a truly evil plan in mind. The record drop of the pound happened on the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. <CN> The 100 million pounds they donated to charity on Ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> The FBI is investigating the mass shooting as terrorism and suggested the gunman may have leanings toward Islamic extremism. If we thought Islamic extremism is a phenomenon reserved for foreign lands, terrorists have made sure to expose our naiveté. The problem of Islamic extremism is caused - astonishingly enough - by Islamic extremism. Islamic extremism has become fertile ground for many malcontents to protest against their societies. In recent years, Islamic extremism has been developing rapidly inside and outside of Australia. <CN> Right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the US) than those motivated by Islamic extremism.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> The gunmen singled out non-Muslims and killed them, said the police. Why is it that ALL these muslim countries discriminate against the non-muslims? They depict Muslims and non-Muslims sharing how they define their personal struggles. The unfortunate thing is that muslims such as azisk call that into question. Ten days later al-Shabab massacred 36 quarry workers who were non-Muslims. <CN> This is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-Muslims would you?
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> Europeans view Muslims as threats, so their states respond with measures purporting to rid their lands of terrorism. Europeans should not be afraid to allow Muslim students to take classes on Islam in state-financed schools and universities. This means that European jihadists in Syria and Iraq represent a maximum of 0.04 percent of the EU's Muslim population. The European Union is home to 13-20 million Muslims, while Europe as a whole has a Muslim population of 44 million. A European Declaration of Independence, present him as a right-wing nationalist fueled by a combined hatred of Muslims, Marxists and multiculturalists. <CN> Last time I heard Muslims came into Europe to help rebuild it after WW2 when Europeans blew each other up.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> Immediately after the terrorist attacks, Muslims began to feel the heat. Some of the men involved had traveled to the Middle East, others had not. Ted Cruz said in the wake of Tuesday's terrorist attacks in Brussels that law enforcement should closely guard Muslim neighborhoods, prompting swift criticism. In the last five years, only 2% of all terrorist attacks in Europe have been religiously motivated. Canada suffered a string of terrorist attacks last year; the men responsible are believed to have self-radicalized. <CN> Many Muslims, especially those living in the Middle East are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by ISIS.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> Yesterday workmen had blocked the hole the boys dug with timber. The hole is supposed to be funny, according to the FAQ. Arwood said he had been digging the hole for three months. The hole reportedly is in an area blocked off for dune restoration. We all make mistakes, and dirt hole dog is here to judge them. <CN> Think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> Attacks against Christians have intensified as mistrust between Christians and Muslims deepens. If Muslims are to blame for last week's terror attacks, they argued, then Christians must be responsible for the following:1. Since then, dozens of Coptic churches have been attacked, some torched to the ground. Under anti-terror laws journalists are only allowed to report the 'official' version of terror attacks. But the move has prompted accusations Monday that Muslims are attacking minority Christians, who breed the animals. <CN> Should we 'put all Christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? Or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority?
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> It is upto the muslims to reclaim their religion, not the kafirs. If people want to hear Muslims denouncing terrorism, it is all over. This is not the obligation of Muslims alone, but of all of us. And yet, it is Muslims who are offended when we raise these facts. It is muslims who are attacking Christian churches in Nigeria, Egypt and "moderate" Indonesia. <CN> Far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by US and UK intelligence agencies. Are you sure it is Muslims we need to be worried about?
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> The Muslim community at large is not responsible for the violence, and it should not be expected to apologize for the actions of some of its members. But the statement was cryptic about the causes of the violence, blaming persons and organizations for manipulating the situation. The least we can do now is to make sure not to blame the wrong people for the vile actions of a few individuals. We have it in us to create expansive, global communities where violence is unimaginable, poverty is crushed, and all humans can flourish to their greatest potentials. Obama has been absent from the Muslim community for many years. <CN> Why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? And, most importantly, violence does not solve anything.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> The world's only bionic eyes -- implants that can bring sight to the blind -- keep getting better. I say these events have split the whole world into two camps: the camp of belief and the disbelief. So when the swords came after eight years to America, then the whole world has been crying for those criminals who attacked. And when those people have defended and retaliated to what their brothers and sisters have suffered in Palestine and Lebanon, the whole world has been shouting. Don't let the fact that third world dictatorships use the Muslim religions blind you to how terrible Christianity was when it was tied to the king. <CN> An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> The following year , under new anti - terrorist legislation , the government announced that it wanted to ban al - Muhajiroun . Aamer, who is expected to take legal action against the British government, met doctors and lawyers after arriving back in the UK. The NHS, one of the biggest employers of Muslims in the UK, said trusts determined policy individually in accordance with the Equality Act. Mr Trump routinely uses threats to try to get his own way, to attempt to exert leverage over Aberdeenshire council or Scottish government decisions. I acknowledge the dangers of far-right extremism and the ongoing need to counter Islamist ideology not with violence but with better, democratic ideas. <CN> Far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the UK. These are the people you should be looking out for not, Muslims.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> And a series of coordinated ISIS terror attacks last November claimed the lives of 130 people and injured more than 300 in Paris. The attacker yelled at her to go back to her country. American Muslims had nothing to do with the attack in Paris. American Muslims had nothing to do with the attack in Brussels. All 224 people on board -- most of them Russian -- were killed. <CN> How can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks?
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> But when Biso had grown, it became too big to escape the hole. Another sportswriter said Trump used his putter to rake some balls into the hole. For the rest of your life, men will want to put their penis in your hole. When the shooter finally emerged himself through the hole in the wall, he was outnumbered and outgunned. Add 15cm (6in) of broken bricks or clean stone to the base of the hole for drainage. <CN> Dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> It's an attempt at an intervention and a lamentation: Stop fueling fires of hate. I think it's a sign of being more serious, Guisti says. Turkish officials, though, say that the country's policy toward refugees has not changed. A poll conducted by Iceland's market and media research institute MMR showed that 88.5 percent of the population thought the country should accept more refugees. "It's truly sad and very unfortunate that people feel that way," she said. <CN> Or let's not. Let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. Most people want a quiet happy life whatever their faith.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> The President is refusing to use the words "Islamic extremism" or "Muslim terror" instead using the phrase "violent extremism." "British Prime Minister David Cameron told the forum tackling extremism required winning a "battle of hearts and minds" amongst young Muslims. The bullying often works to silence critics of Islamic extremism. ... It's important that law enforcement prosecute hate crimes against Muslims ... Every year Muslims contribute over £31 billion to the UK economy. <CN> Violent extremism is terrible. It is a shame Muslims have to put up with it.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> They also know the undeveloped status of technology within the Muslim countries in comparison with the West. How do you view women as being treated -- Muslim countries. The survey continues:Nonetheless, Muslim Americans have not become disillusioned with the country. But some of the worst abuse actually takes place in Muslim-dominated countries. Don't you think it the non-muslims in the Islamic countries deserve anything? <CN> The West continually bombs Middle Eastern and Muslim countries. Maybe we should stop blowing people up.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> Few people believe they are bad drivers, but thousands of us still have accidents each year. Fatal road accidents are common in Pakistan, where public transport drivers are often poorly trained and work long hours. Tesla has previously suggested that the accident resulted from the driver's failure to remain in control of the vehicle. This may sound strict but is significant more lenient than previous regulations which treated bikers like drivers, including fines and jail. Serious traffic accidents are common in China due to often overloaded vehicles and poorly trained drivers who often ignore traffic laws. <CN> More people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too?
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> It's a time-honored tradition — blame the nurse whenever anything goes wrong. Because when it came to the day-to-day nursing, we were scared. In reality, my species of doctor will soon be extinct, replaced by nurse practitioners. If doctors are generals, nurses are a combination of infantry and aides-de-camp. We said: Doctors, we know you're busy and sometimes forget to wash your hands. <CN> And after you have done that, who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard day's graft and nurse those calluses on your hands? And do not get me started on the doctors you might need.
<HS> We need to kill Muslims, otherwise, they will make us explode! <knowl> Have "we" been doing that, smearing Islam because of a small minority? Worldwide, Sunnis make up about 85 percent of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims. This awakening gives a little hint of where the U.S. Muslim population is headed. About 2 percent of the state's population is Muslim, one of the country's higher concentrations, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. Now we're down to 6, we got rid of all these people. <CN> Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead.
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> A thousand years of Jewish civilisation in central and eastern Europe had been swept away. In the 4th century, millions of Europe's peoples were — as they are today — on the move. Wars of independence became wars of peoples and wars of religion. Back then the level of debate was both erudite and civilised. After a few years, more than 16 million people were dead. <CN> All peoples have a place in every part of the world.

Back then the level of debate was both erudite and civilised. Islam, by contrast, entered Europe regarding the divine as something beyond criticism. <CN> A 'civilised Europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; Islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised.

Reflections on the Revolution in Europe was received with much critical tenderness. Norway's enlightened response could be a model elsewhere in Europe too.

What makes you say this? How are muslims 'uncivilised'?
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> ""We hope this will be a small contribution to unity in the Islamic world. Europe highlights Al Jazeera English language channel's commitment to covering news from a grass roots level," she continued. Third, the Islamic world contains multitudes: It is vast and varied. Islam, by contrast, entered Europe regarding the divine as something beyond criticism. Second, today the Islamic world includes a strain that truly is disproportionately intolerant and oppressive. <CN> Shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the English language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised Europe' from the Islamic world?
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> While Europe skulked through its millennium of Christian repression, Indian art was civilised and joyous. He is the most civilised and civilising of recent artists, a man who read endlessly and expects the same of his beholders.

Houellebecq draws a parallel with the situation before the first world war: This Europe, which was the culmination of human civilisation, committed suicide, which lasted several decades. The selfie era is a golden age of the civilised nude. <CN> They are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild our civilization after the war.

<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> We must get past the fear and ignorance that breeds hate. Civilisation is about living together, people pooling their resources, sharing the same space. What ever ideology drove him to want to kill those people should be hated.

Posted by: tjhall1 | January 27, 2010 1:25 PM Report Offensive CommentÂ«People who hate Jews also hate Muslims. <CN> Do people who make such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then?
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> Injecting hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, of people who look, speak and act differently into these settings often makes for a difficult social fit. Their understanding of Islam comes from what they are taught by others. The founders of Political Islam are known as the innovators of this trend. There is only one solution: we must eradicate its traditions and immediately initiate its hundreds of millions of people into other cultures lest they spread their poison all over the world. Muhammad isn't simply a historical figure to them, but rather a personal inspiration to hundreds of millions of people around the world today. <CN> Is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of Islam? Would you think that about any other religion?
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> A thousand years of Jewish civilisation in central and eastern Europe had been swept away. Christianity took on its own historically decisive character in Europe as a faith coloured by rational self-inquiry and, eventually, deferential to secular authority.

Islam, by contrast, entered Europe regarding the divine as something beyond criticism. <CN> How can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people?

<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> Media orientalism seemed to believe that 'democratic Muslims could no longer be Muslims'. In Europe, where Muslims make for much larger minorities, open violence is common. Even America and Europe have growing if not flourishing Muslim minorities through migrations and conversions.

We have peace loving, law-abiding Muslim-Americans in neighborhoods all across New York City - they should be respected like all other members of our communities. They believe the Europe-inspired legislation encourages unelected judges to put the rights of criminals over those of the law-abiding. Every new law places a burden on law-abiders and law-breakers alike. <CN> Muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the UK economically and culturally.

<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> The world's leading drug maker by sales, Pfizer was accused of bribing doctors, hospital administrators and regulators in several countries in Europe and Asia to prescribe medicines. About 80% of the drugs MSF uses to treat AIDS patients come from India. The peace-loving majority of people must become vociferous in promoting global civility and responsible debate. If you look at what happens in those countries that aren't part of the EU, on average it takes longer to get new medicines approved, said Patrick Vallance, president of pharmaceutical research and development at GlaxoSmithKline. The White House expressed solidarity and vowed to "fight the scourge of terrorism," offering all three countries "any necessary support". <CN> We still use Arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from Islamic countries. Islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it.
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> We need to work for a Europe that empowers our citizens and our economy. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., claimed hate groups increasingly are targeting Muslims in the United States. Research shows that Muslim Americans are less likely to endorse violence against civilians than other religious groups. One recent poll found that British Muslims donate more money to charity than any other religious group. Durbin, who announced his hearing shortly after King's concluded, acknowledged Tuesday that other religious groups face discrimination. <CN> Oh, the same Muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups.

Obviously, the vast majority of Muslims would never do anything like this, said Maher. While Europe skulked through its millennium of Christian repression, Indian art was civilised and joyous. The vast, vast majority of Muslims in this country and around the world are moderates. fine sense of humour is one of the defining characteristics of highly evolved, civilised human beings. <CN> Well most Muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of Muslims in the UK are proud to be British, work hard and and contribute to the economy.
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> All of us, in the nation's interest, [need] to say we are the most successful multicultural society in the world.

The deal that Europe has made with Erdogan's Turkey to manage refugee flows will face new pressures as European governments balk at keeping promises of visa-free travel through Europe for Turks. The rise of extremists who lure young Muslims in the West with visions of Islamic utopia is creating nausea among European Muslims. Since 9/11, so many European Muslims have also doubted their belonging. <CN> After world war 2 European governments recruited Muslims to rebuild Europe. There would not be a civilised Europe without Muslims.
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> The outdoor TV celebrities pride themselves on being clean and humane hunters. In this election, the center and the left tried various tricks to gain an edge — for instance, by filling their ranks with former journalists and TV celebrities. On the main stage, TV celebrities were being interviewed, and the crowd was going wild. The National Revival Party evoked change through the youthful looks of its celebrity candidates and their non-political backgrounds. It hosts year-round paranormal tours and ghost hunts, even inviting TV celebrities to give seminars and lead special private hunts. <CN> Every single Muslim? Even our Olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. You really think they have no place in civilisation?

Muslims are not alone in finding themselves in conflict with Europe's new order. An important alternative to the feeling French question is asking Muslims how they view their integration in Europe. Furthermore, it shows that, in spite of everything, Muslims in Europe seem to be doing better when it comes to embracing diversity and democratic values ​​than Muslims in Islamic countries. While much of the Muslim and Christian population growth is expected to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, the share of Muslims in Europe and the U.S. is also expected to grow. <CN> Some of the oldest civilisations in existence are Islamic. I would not call the religious hatred directed at Muslims in Europe 'civilised'.
<HS> Europe is civilised, Muslims should not stay there. <knowl> Europe's bigger problem is the divide between its Muslim and non-Muslim communities. The growth of the two religions leaves only about one in 10 people in sub-Saharan African who are neither Muslim nor Christian, the study found. A climate of fear is taking hold in Europe, as ordinary people increasingly heed rightist rhetoric equating the millions of peaceful Muslims with the few plotting murder and mayhem. Impressionable young people should know that their communities reject violence, and Muslims should indeed speak out — and they do. Hundreds of people from both faiths have died in violence between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria in the past decade. <CN> Why? The Muslims I know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion?

The ADL surveyed 53,100 adults in 102 countries, presenting them with a list of 11 Jewish stereotypes, ranging from fear of Jewish control over banks, media and world affairs to theories of group psychology. <CN> The negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all Muslims.

Devoted Christian families would have to miss school just as the country's Muslim youth should do for Eid ul-Fitr and Eid Ul-Adha. Why do we ridicule Muslims for eating "kosher", but not Jews? Putin would alienate the entire Sunni Muslim world, including Russian Muslims. Many Muslims in New York live under an umbrella of fear. <CN> I have so many amazing Muslim friends.

<HS> We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country. <knowl> In most countries, Muslims are much more worried about Islamic extremists than Christian extremists. I urge any muslim country withhelp the Rohingya muslims beingslaughtered by the Myanmar terrorists. Why are the existing laws of the muslim countries so hateful towards the non-muslims? This country was so much better off before muslim ranks began to swell in the west. Over all, about a third of the country thought more than half, most or all Muslims supported ISIS. <CN> That is quite a generalisation. What have 'all' Muslims done to deserve being deported?
<HS> We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country. <knowl> Our country has lost a pioneer woman, our community has lost a gracious leader, and our family has lost a dear friend.

The race to replace Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, began as a fairly quiet contest focused on health care and jobs before shifting abruptly when thousands of immigrant children began pouring into the country and some settled in the state. <CN> By 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here?
<HS> We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country. <knowl> India is similar to many Asian countries in that many families prefer boys. That's the same dislike and distrust that makes fat people less likely to be hired for jobs, take home equal pay or receive adequate medical care under their insurance.

But, believe me, the rest of the country - employers, jurors, neighbours, voters - thinks of you collectively and treats you accordingly.

We are teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, store owners and business leaders. We need to find better ways to attract talented people to become teachers. People of various faiths resided in my community: Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Mormons.

I certainly want all our Muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here.
<HS> We should expel Muslims, everyone wants them out of the country. <knowl> The idea is that tolerance is largely a question of getting to know people. We must think of the economic development of 60 million people. Playing the homophobia card is costlier than playing the Islamophobia card.

But I felt angry at the violent responses of SOME Muslims. <CN> You are aware there are millions of Muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse.

Prince Charles lobbied over NHS homeopathy fundingThere are 500 farmers trained in homeopathy and 38 homeopathic vets, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. <CN> Then why did we ask them to come in the first place, wasn't it to save our NHS, run the trains and post office. None of those were doing very well last time I looked, I think we might actually still need them.
<HS> Muslims had destroyed a Christian statue in Italy. Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why is tolerating these despicable people. <knowl> If our hope is for salvation in this sense — and for many that is the main point of religion—then this hope depends on certain religious beliefs' being true. Failing that, we may need to reconsider John Gray's idea of religion with little or no belief. And Chicago traveler -- -- best -- in Italy -- visited. He points out that in many cases — for instance, polytheism, Hinduism and Buddhism, Daoism and Shinto, many strands of Judaism and some Christian and Muslim traditions — belief is of little or no importance. Catholic commentator and author Lavinia Byrne, a former nun, pointed out that Christians' "voluntary embrace of suffering" was as old as the religion itself. <CN> Because one person does not represent a whole religion, which one person today could reflect the whole of Christianity through their behaviour and belief?

Italy should ask itself why they are allowed to build mosques and why is tolerating these despicable people. <knowl> People are concerned that I'm disrespecting the flag, but that was never my intent. It's not atheists in general who are angry; it's just the angry ones. The administration has gone too far in disrespecting the freedom of Americans to live out their convictions. Yet tolerance is in short supply in Pakistan these days, and accusations of disrespecting Islam can be fatal.

Perhaps the most salient point about the latest developments in Italy is that investors should start paying more attention to idiosyncratic, or country-specific, risks. In July, the government of Madhya Pradesh state in India followed suit. With liberalizing governments in the region—Vietnam is begging for foreign investment and even Mynamar is turning closer to democracy—many agree with Pangestu's generalization. Equality rampant!Similarly, the phrase "qualified minorities" may not be used in stories about affirmative action, lest it leave the impression that "minorities are generally unqualified." <CN> This is generalization.

Out of *you* Spidey, I see only filth, blindness, violence, repression, and hate. These guys are engaging in straight-up defamation of a very large group of people.

Hemingway family mental illness exploredIn the aftermath of the senseless tragedies that just keep on coming and the stigmatizing hysteria that came with them, we desperately need a compassionate reality check against our exaggerated fears of people with mental illness. In the case of mental illness there is so much fear, ignorance and hurtful attitudes that the people who suffer from mental illness needlessly suffer further. It says that mental illness affects ordinary people in normal domestic settings. In CBT, essentially, one learns to either reimagine the significance of illness or discover ways of correcting patterns of unhealthy behavior. <CN> Tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy.
<HS> It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims. <knowl> Folks, our public schools have become indoctrination centers - promoting Islam and marginalizing every other religion. It is perfectly reasonable for critics to point to the shortcomings of Islam or any other religion.

So ingrained is violence in the religion that Islam has never really stopped being at war, either with other religions or with itself.

Accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others.
<HS> It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims. <knowl> Islamic traditions include:Muslims often joke that they start fasting on different days. To try and project Christians as violent and intolerant as the Muslims is absurd. This is normative Islam, adhered to by a billion normal Muslims across the globe. [After the Ottawa attack] media here did not make those connections to Islam and Muslims. Contributing to the overall good of society is a core Islamic principle compulsory for all Muslims. <CN> Or maybe appeasement to Muslims is just tolerance and understanding. Give that a try!
<HS> It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims. <knowl> And the stigma of mental illness often discourages people from seeking treatment in the first place. "The problem with mental illness is people don't look at it as a physical illness. This, too, has importance for understanding our attitudes to mental illness.

<HS> It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims. <knowl> His father said he remembers a deeply troubled son who struggled with what he described as a history of mental illness. Breivik's extraordinarily well-organized and methodical massacre also undermines the idea that he was suffering from a serious mental illness. "I'm not saying her actions were a direct product of mental illness, but she's a bit of a mess," Moore said. The toxic cocktail of gun violence, unchecked mental illness and deranged ideology that propelled the massacre at Pulse is a threat to all Americans.

Yet we should be cautious about doing the right thing for the wrong reasons; exaggerating the link between mental illness and violence perpetuates the stigma of mental illness. The overlap between art and mental illness is, of course, very broad.

<HS> It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims. <knowl> It's important that Americans understand Islam does not condone violence or the imposition of religious beliefs. Finally, moderate Islam must powerfully reject the barbaric practices of jihadists. Everyone wants the legacy of our forefathers to match their beliefs. It has taught people of different races to live in brotherhood and people of different creeds to live side by side in reasonable tolerance. We should go ahead and build worship centres of other faiths too. <CN> Maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. They call it tolerance.
<HS> It is obviously a mental illness, the conciliation to Islam and Muslims. <knowl> In most countries, Muslims are much more worried about Islamic extremists than Christian extremists. Instead of fearing them, my Nation colleague Joshua Holland wrote in December, we should be thankful that American Muslims are as successful and well-integrated into our society as they are. People don't realize that there is a diversity of opinion within Islam and that most Muslims condemn extremism and violence. Islamic political parties are least popular in the Palestinian territories — perhaps indicating a rejection of Hamas — as well as in Kazakhstan and Bosnia. However, al Qaeda did succeed in pulling the United States into a position in the Muslim world that has alienated much of Muslim society. <CN> Most Muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society.

Islam never changes any cultures in the past and will not do in the future.

Other prominent Muslim women said they saw hypocrisy in Trump standing up for women's rights in Muslim populations but not in his own family. Malala Yousafzai, from Pakistan, was just a child when she was almost murdered. <CN> Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on.

"Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former Conservative Party chairwoman andÂ the first Muslim woman to serve in the Tory cabinet, recently defected to the "Remain" camp. <CN> How about influential figures like Baroness Sayeeda Warsi?

Against this backdrop of targeting of women in religious garb, any policy that links the burkini with terrorism puts Muslim women further in the crosshairs of Islamophobic violence. <CN> What is the point in listening to Western men? They are all Islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions.

Iranian law says women have to wear a hijab in public, while Saudi Arabia requires Muslim women to wear the hijab. Walker-Diallo is not the first Muslim judge to serve in the state. The women have sort of become the banner of Islam, said Haddad, co-author of Muslim Women in America: The Challenge of Islamic Identity Today.

<HS> I do not really understand why I should listen to Muslim women. They are evidently dumb. <knowl> Muslim women in the UK have asserted they have something to say and he ought to listen. The organisation said in its submission Muslim women were invisible in the debate over family violence.

<HS> Muslims in Britain vote for the Labour party. This is why the problem of antisemitism is not solved. It is a mathematical fact! <knowl> Shah's suspension was the latest in a series of incidents which have raised questions about antisemitism in the Labour party. On to antisemitism, which Corbyn says has no place in the Labour party. Corbyn has insisted there is not a huge problem with antisemitism in Labour and the issue is limited to a very small number of people. Livingstone repeated earlier claims that in his 47 years in the Labour party, he had not encountered antisemitism or racism. In the last few weeks we have witnessed a stream of clear cut cases of antisemitism in the Labour party, which can't just be fobbed off as differences over Israel. <CN> Are you accusing all the Britain Muslims of antisemitism? I disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.
<HS> Muslims in Britain vote for the Labour party. This is why the problem of antisemitism is not solved. It is a mathematical fact! <knowl> Every Labour leader needs to command the support of their MPs in the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), as well as party members, in order to achieve that. In another email Beckett wrote Comms will prepare the nasty stuff we know of individuals in the Labour Party. Knight was one of many who had joined the Labour party from the Socialist Labour League, and in Norwood Labour party he formed an alliance with Ken Livingstone.

Livingstone told MPs that he was acutely disappointed that Shami Chakrabarti, the chair of the independent inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party, had said she would call him to give evidence. <CN> I do not think Muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. Thus, I do not think the labour party is biased towards them.
<HS> Muslims in Britain vote for the Labour party. This is why the problem of antisemitism is not solved. It is a mathematical fact! <knowl> But he added of the actual election in May: The Tories will be ahead of the Labour party in terms of numbers of votes. In effect the Labour party hierarchy is no-platforming supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. In another email Beckett wrote Comms will prepare the nasty stuff we know of individuals in the Labour Party. In fact, they are scars that still disfigure the entire Labour Party. This morning it's not the good name of the Labour Party that is on the line, but that of Miliband himself. <CN> Do you know the numbers of the votes of Britain Muslims?
<HS> Muslims in Britain vote for the Labour party. This is why the problem of antisemitism is not solved. It is a mathematical fact! <knowl> Falkirk has become a gold-plated Labour Party cock-up and a gold-plated Labour Party conspiracy.

It is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well.
<HS> Muslims are contaminating our world. <knowl> The world has lost its way and most people just don't care. The world is full of crazy people who do bad things in response to the voices they hear. And looking at the world we live in today, I'd say he's fooled a lot of people. Jihad is the advancement of Islam and terror does just the opposite turning the world's people away from Islam. How would everyone feel if we 'draw' pictures of planes crashing into world trade centre or people jumping of that building. <CN> A religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague.
<HS> Muslims are contaminating our world. <knowl> Most importantly, however, the toxic nature of the News of the World brand was in danger of contaminating the whole News Corp. operation. I can only say this "you are NAIVE like many Hindus are". No contaminating celestial bodies, and no contaminating Earth with anything you bring back. Much like favoring sharia law, religious devotion played an important role in these beliefs. It said the man admitted to using the potentially hazardous material to contaminate food. <CN> It is just a religion like Christianity or any other. Get over it.
<HS> Muslims are contaminating our world. <knowl> "Those who are spreading messages of intolerance and hatred must not go unchallenged. To me the only thing this man teaches is hate and intolerance towards others. The battle must be fought, a battle against intolerance, hatred, myth of cultural superiority and will to hegemony over the other. Muslims, a quarter of the world's population, citizens of every country, have a central role in the future of our planet. I want to defend Muslims from intolerance, but I also want to defend America against extremists engineering a spasm of religious hatred. <CN> Hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet.
<HS> Muslims are contaminating our world. <knowl> Religions get ridiculed when their followers bomb kindergartens and oppress people. I have all the respect in the world for all religions. Call yourself a religion and then threaten to kill people, wow. You people live in a morally disintegrated society of naked (free) people. The only thing that religion does is tear people and societies apart. <CN> Dare to explain why? I see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us.
<HS> Muslims are contaminating our world. <knowl> "No mystery which major world religion (Islam) is the main instigator of anti-Jewish hate. There is a wicked ideology in the world - fundamentalist religion. The religion of Islam doesnt âask" for submission, it demands it. This is NOT about religion, not about Islam, not even about Muslims. <CN> Replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is.
<HS> Muslims are contaminating our world. <knowl> In our ever-shrinking world, the tentacles of religion touch everything from governmental policy to individual morality to our basic social constructs. When you look at politics or you look around the world, a lot of negative things are being said about Islam, Yuceturk said. proving that Islam is terrorism to the whole world," Botros said. Our initiative is intended to cultivate understanding among all religions and cultures. Here, people from different religions socialized in harmony and lived in peace. <CN> Clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.Why so negative?
<HS> Islam is comparable to a disease to eliminate. <knowl> The researchers aimed to compare the cancer beliefs of British South Asian cancer patients with those of Caucasian cancer patients. And among Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander populations, cancer is the number one killer. She added that doctors should "actively survey" people at high risk of squamous cell cancer such as smokers. At the same time, substituting fatty protein sources with soy can help promote weight loss and curb obesity, another risk factor for prostate cancer. In his 20s, Mr. Ho briefly joined the Nation of Islam and then the I Wor Kuen, a radical Asian-American group inspired by the Black Panthers. <CN> Actually 26% of British doctors who are Asian or British/Asian are helping to fight cancer.
<HS> Islam is comparable to a disease to eliminate. <knowl> There is no comparable product available for people who need the drug. A decade ago, many people kept their cancer a secret at work, she claims. That compared with 17% of people who earned a degree before marrying and were obese. In other words, for every 100 people who stop eating bacon, only one will have avoided cancer. She added that doctors should "actively survey" people at high risk of squamous cell cancer such as smokers. <CN> An entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer.
<HS> Islam is comparable to a disease to eliminate. <knowl> The hater always suffers more than the object of his hatred. But I can still raise my voice against words of hatred. They also looked at patterns in the mutations associated with certain cancers. And by the way, radical Islam poses a threat to Muslims themselves. We owe it to our faith, and we owe it to our country. <CN> What is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith.
<HS> Islam is comparable to a disease to eliminate. <knowl> While he is no Jeffersonian democrat, neither does he compare to the barbarism of the Islamic radicals. In 2009, Al-Azhar, a noted center of Islamic teachings, co-hosted President Obama's famous speech to the Muslim world. In our judgment, building an Islamic Center in the shadow of the World Trade Center will cause some victims more pain - unnecessarily - and that is not right. The debilitating disease affects fewer than 40 people in the world. Nationalism of the Islamic Resistance Movement is part of its religion. <CN> We would live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead.
<HS> Benefits and access to our national health service must be stopped for Muslims. We should ban them from the UK! <knowl> We should be clear that what we have is a free National Health Service, not a free International Health Service. The decision by the National Institute for Health Care Excellence, which does cost-benefit analyses for England's National Health Service, sent Vertex's stock down 7.6 percent to $80.15. The UK's publicly funded National Health Service means insurance and employee health are less intricately bound. The National Health Service, which is financed by taxes and payroll deductions, delivers most care for free. Among arguments by Brexit supporters are that immigrants are putting too much pressure on public services, like the country's National Health Service, and social welfare benefits. <CN> Eradicating these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. Maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. It might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory.
<HS> Benefits and access to our national health service must be stopped for Muslims.

The National Health Service is the closest thing the English have to a religion, he wrote. The National Health Service, which is financed by taxes and payroll deductions, delivers most care for free. The National Health Service has been praised for providing universal access while being cost effective, while the American system, despite the introduction of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, is still so expensive that many people cannot afford treatment. <CN> 26% of all doctors working in the NHS are Asian or Asian British, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day?

<HS> Benefits and access to our national health service must be stopped for Muslims. We should ban them from the UK! <knowl> We are proud to be British because Muslims have contributed to the success of Britain. The rise in the Muslim population, especially because of a high birth rate, means that Muslim clusters are getting bigger. Private landlords will be forced to check tenants' immigration status, and immigrants' access to the National Health Service will be restricted. Naseem Mahdi is the National Vice President and Missionary Incharge of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, USA - the oldest Muslim Organization in the US. A massive 83 per cent of Muslims said they were proud to be British  compared with the national average of 79 per cent. <CN> Muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-Muslim British population.

<HS> If they do not adapt to our culture, they can go away. <knowl> Further delay will only jeopardise the future of the UK economy. Every year Muslims contribute over £31 billion to the UK economy. PMI data just out reveals that UK economy has deteriorated post Brexit. Second, the UK economy has returned to growth more strongly than most expected. In 2001, just 33 per cent of British Muslims lived in Britain's poorest places. <CN> 95% of British Muslims feel a loyalty to the UK and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the UK economy.

<HS> If they do not adapt to our culture, they can go away. <knowl> However, doubts remain: "Most refugees are willing to assimilate and welcome any political and societal support," Saadi said. This dark past fuels an unspoken argument against assimilation and adaptation. You should definitely integrate with the German society, but we are against assimilation. Muslim minorities there seem to be less integrated than in other European countries. Also, a lack of Muslim leadership among the Muslim minority perpetuates the problems. <CN> One of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. Maybe if you made Muslims feel more welcome, they would?
<HS> If they do not adapt to our culture, they can go away. <knowl> We have many reasons to anticipate positive change in the near future. We had to start creating committees of people to help us manage our culture. There are many reasons to want 2016 over with, but what of the promise of 2017? VA experts are also studying the many reasons why female veterans have such a higher risk for suicide attempts. There are plenty of costumes that don't hurt other people's feelings and don't degrade other people. <CN> Many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported.
<HS> If they do not adapt to our culture, they can go away. <knowl> Multicultural societies make immigrant children feel accepted in their own right.

Human clinical trials for an Ebola vaccine began only this year. <CN> This sounds like a science fiction if you ask me!
<HS> Never share a meal with a Muslim: you could catch HIV or Ebola. <knowl> About 68 HIV-infected children receive free medical care at the hospice. He said desperation pushed him to treat Ebola patients using several different medications. But still if something like Ebola was to spread rapidly, there wouldn't be the resources in the world. Their goal is to coordinate a comprehensive approach to contain the epidemic through carefully collaborated medical care and social services. Costs associated with Ebola, however, may rack up as much as $32.6 billion, the World Bank said last week. <CN> Fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. Need I go on?
<HS> I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you! <knowl> Of course, Benedict can get away with offending Muslims more easily at the moment than he can with offending Jews. While the Muslim community has the right to build the mosque they are abusing that right by needlessly offending so many people who have suffered so much. Representative Peter King, a New York Republican, said that while the Muslim community has the right to build the mosque, doing so needlessly offends too many people. Was it rude to tell a person to stop being rude? A Florida gun shop owner has banned Muslim customers from his store. <CN> Why are you so rude to other people? I do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them for sure.
<HS> I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you! <knowl> Muslim leaders estimate that one in eight city school kids come from Muslim families. Other Muslim Americans told CNN that they hope that Trump's election will allow other marginalized peoples to ban together. "Muslims, these artefacts behind me are idols for people from ancient times who worshipped them instead of God," the solider said. The Pakistan Muslim League of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif pulled out of a coalition with its longtime rival, the Pakistan Peoples Party. He was addressing a summit of Muslim leaders from Latin America. <CN> So much hatred. We must respect and understand all peoples.
<HS> I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you! <knowl> "The way kids express anger evolves much as they do, from uncivilized to articulate. The media doesn't help, defining her son as Somali and Muslim instead of a kid. Experts say addressing the problem requires the cooperation of non-Muslim parents and teachers to educate their kids. To those who are already blaming the Muslim community; your anger is misguided and ignorant, to put it politely. But exactly because I'm a good Muslim, I'm not going to take my anger out on anyone. <CN> May I remind you to mind your language? Do you want to share me with your anger, maybe I can help you?
<HS> I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you! <knowl> But remember: That's also true of the person on the phone in the next seat who seems rude to you. Secretly photographing a nursing mom and then posting the image on the Internet and mocking her is downright rude, tasteless and inconsiderate. The thin air and high stress, plus attitudes toward airlines and their employees, seem to foment rude, even violent behavior—not to mention all the disgusting... As he aptly noted each time, what these people were doing was rude and inconsiderate; it wasn't his responsibility to get out of the way. Do people honestly think that this makes a person feel young? <CN> I do not know what Muslims have done to you, but I know many beautiful and kind persons among them. So it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting.
<HS> I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you! <knowl> "She is an amazing and attentive mother and everything she does is with the kids in mind. "Excuse my ignorance, but I didn't know whether Muslim kids are allowed to play with dolls," he said. Acton-Smith, who has no kids of his own, is serious when he says Mind Candy aims to become the Disney of digital entertainment. "See why this portrayal of Muslim Americans is so ... dangerous?

<HS> I will not allow my kids to marry a muslim! Go to hell Muslims, I hate you! <knowl> "She raised four kids, and has 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Grandparents have to be mindful of that and respect how their kids treat their own children. There has been a shift in the way people bring up their children, says Christine Northam, a Relate counsellor. People have to realize I'm not doing this to harm or insult anyone or bring back bad memories. It's important that you feel able to say no to looking after your grandchildren without upsetting your children. <CN> You have a stance, that is your right. But it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people.
<HS> I support China, they forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. This is how you do it! <knowl> For Muslims in Pakistan, drinking alcohol is prohibited and talking about it is taboo. Donald Trump reportedly doesn't drink alcohol, even though he's sold vodka under his name in the past. About 66 percent of American adults drink alcohol, according to 2001-2002 figures from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. She enjoyed a world-class education and never felt like an outsider, other than when kids occasionally asked why she didn't eat pork or drink alcohol. I have written a letter to the Chinese authorities indicating that their ban on U.S. pork products into China is ill-advised, not based on science. <CN> You really want to support the role of the State in prescribing what people should eat or drink?
<HS> I support China, they forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. This is how you do it! <knowl> Many users worldwide have joined the trend, including Muslims expressing appreciation for the support. But he added that the outlook for pork imports by China would also help producers in other regions. Donald Trump reportedly doesn't drink alcohol, even though he's sold vodka under his name in the past. She enjoyed a world-class education and never felt like an outsider, other than when kids occasionally asked why she didn't eat pork or drink alcohol. ""It can include activities such as praying, wearing Islamic headscarves, growing beards, learning about Islam, fasting, deciding not to drink alcohol, and even going to mosques," the study continued. <CN> Aren't you expressing support for a form of torture? Whatever happened to 'British values'?
<HS> I support China, they forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. This is how you do it! <knowl> The three-flavor pork dumplings at China North Dumpling have a crisp bottom. The standouts, above, at China North Dumpling — pork and chive...China North Dumpling sits on Noriega Street. Donald Trump reportedly doesn't drink alcohol, even though he's sold vodka under his name in the past. The standouts, above, at China North Dumpling — pork and chive...Workers make dumplings at China North Dumpling in San Francisco. Because like Muslims, Mormons do not drink alcohol, our trip to the temple is usually followed by a stop at Dairy Queen. <CN> Doing it right'? I think you have got your moral compass upside down!
<HS> I support China, they forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. This is how you do it! <knowl> In Mississippi, where one of the worst things you can say about someone is that their peas taste like dishwater, no one eats rice with peas. For one thing, the bag of dried peas you picked up at the grocery store for New Year's Day was most likely grown in California. She enjoyed a world-class education and never felt like an outsider, other than when kids occasionally asked why she didn't eat pork or drink alcohol. Pork tenderloin is a quick meal in the skillet or oven. Pork loin is larger and meatier, and takes longer to cook. <CN> Being forced to eat my peas when I was a kid just made me hate them even more. Still cannot stomach the damn things.
<HS> I support China, they forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. This is how you do it! <knowl> In China, the government is persecuting Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims. The Dalai Lama is the traditional religious and temporal head of Tibetan Buddhists. Lhasa, a site of supreme significance for Tibetan Buddhists, is awash with brothels and barracks. While the culture of the towns, Dharamsala and McLeod Ganj, are predominantly Tibetan Buddhist, the small surrounding villages are more Indian and attract an international hippy crowd. The tier 1 countries are typically cited for state-sponsored or state-enforced religious discrimination, such as China's suppression of Tibetan Buddhists or Iran's prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accuse. <CN> Would you say the same if this was about, say, Tibetan Buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion?
<HS> Isis bride wants to return to our country, we must not let her in! They aren't british! Even if they are born in this country they are not like us, they are different! Not british! <knowl> It will not even mean that the rule of law now exists in Guatemala. This doesn't look like a triumph of justice and rule of law to me. We're not following the rule of law than the 21 century. The point of this exercise was to demonstrate the rule of law in practice complying with international standards but demonstrated by Iraqi judges. If we succeed, we are well on our way to having a legal system, a society that will accept the rule of law. <CN> Given that a belief in the rule of Law is generally cited as a 'British value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the UK to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed?
<HS> Isis bride wants to return to our country, we must not let her in! They aren't british! Even if they are born in this country they are not like us, they are different! Not british! <knowl> Szydlowski said he had discussed with his long-term British girlfriend the option of acquiring UK citizenship through marriage. British teens have been swept up in the allure of ISIS. Britain typically strips people of citizenship when they are outside the country. Earlier this month, undercover journalists approached several companies based in the country asking about the possibility of buying citizenship for a rich Indian businessman. The ellipses give a sense of the geographical range of each genetic cluster. <CN> Dog's and horse's do not have passports. A stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics.
<HS> Isis bride wants to return to our country, we must not let her in! They aren't british! Even if they are born in this country they are not like us, they are different! Not british! <knowl> British teens have been swept up in the allure of ISIS. She stunned her family, left her country and became an ISIS bride and recruiter. The British Cleveland Bay Horse Society also maintains a separate registry for part - bred horses . In the 1920s , Cleveland Bays replaced black Hanoverians in the British royal stables , and both the Cleveland Bay and Cleveland Bay / Thoroughbred crosses are used as royal carriage horses today . He said: "People across this country will have been sickened by the fact that it could have been a British citizen - a British citizen - who could have carried out this unspeakable act. <CN> A British dog born in a British stable is not a horse, but it's still British. We have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our Citizens, be they good or evil surely?
<HS> If you practice a non-indigenous faith, you are allowed to pray only in your home. Stop building mosques! <knowl> This is a place of worship that was founded by African Americans seeking liberty. It bans overnight sit-ins (like Tahrir Square) and protests at places of worship. The Islamic State group has in the past attacked Shiite places of worship in Qatif. Political groups across the spectrum have staged their protests following the end of Friday prayers. A burning object was thrown at a mosque in Vlaardingen, on the outskirts of Rotterdam. <CN> Aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers?
<HS> If you practice a non-indigenous faith, you are allowed to pray only in your home. Stop building mosques! <knowl> That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan." It is also a regular place of worship for Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini. Instead, she said she took a walk on the beach and visited the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, which she called a peaceful and powerful place of worship. In the 18th century theologian Wesley (1703-91) held prayer meetings in the building before his move to a purpose-built place of worship - the New Room. Perhaps this time to discuss the controversial plans to build a mosque near Ground Zero? <CN> You seem to be suggesting only Christians should be allowed a place of worship?
<HS> If you practice a non-indigenous faith, you are allowed to pray only in your home. Stop building mosques! <knowl> The Gospels often described Jesus as " of Nazareth , " but never as " of Bethlehem " . A character in the Gospel of John states that Jesus is from Galilee , and not Bethlehem . Muslims are in fact the only non-Christians on earth who believe that Jesus was born of a virgin. The New Testament says that Jesus' birth took place in Bethlehem, in a manger or at an inn, when Mary was with her husband, Joseph. Jupiter next continued to move and then it stopped in its apparent retrograde motion on December 25 of 2 BC over the town of Bethlehem . <CN> Christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given Jesus was born in Bethlehem!

In Dair Azour, video footage showed protesters singing a song by a popular folk singer who was recently killed in Hama by security forces. After Friday prayers at the American Moslem Society mosque in Dearborn, Mich., Yemeni-Americans voiced their support for the demonstrations sweeping the Middle East. <CN> They are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work in our factories, NHS and transport.

Sharon Fairley, head of the police oversight board that released the video, described the footage as "shocking and disturbing. This video footage, which was released on Friday, prompted Chicago police to warn of "civil unrest" and potential violence against cops. <CN> So these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in Saville and then made a life for themselves?

<HS> Islam is totalitarian: Muslims want to invade every country. If we want to live in a multicultural world we need some countries without Islam. <knowl> If you really want to compare, then please compare 3rd world islamic nations with 3rd world christian nations. Without a shadow of doubt there is some cause to be afraid or vary of islam through out the world. The ultimate goal of Islam is not to convert the world but to establish Sharia law over the entire world. Basic principles of Islam are that the world must be ruled by sharia; that the world government should be ruled by Muslims; and that any people who do not submit to Islam are automatically enemies. The increasingly religious bent of Malaysia's authorities contrasts sharply with the country's reputation as a holdout for moderation in the Islamic world. <CN> By your logic, the world will be diverse so long as Islam isn't practiced in Antactica?
<HS> Islam is totalitarian: Muslims want to invade every country. If we want to live in a multicultural world we need some countries without Islam. <knowl> Islamism is not Islam, but it is an offshoot of Islam. No matter how anxious people may be about Islam, the notion of a Muslim invasion of this majority Christian country has no basis in fact. The country is a staunch ally and a key provider of oil. It isn't fair to blame Islam for the atrocities of violent radicals. Islam is a religion, and like any other faith, it is internally diverse. <CN> I am not sure I would use 'invasion' to describe the spread of a particular faith or belief, but isn't' that what religions do. Spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation?
<HS> Islam is totalitarian: Muslims want to invade every country. If we want to live in a multicultural world we need some countries without Islam. <knowl> "the new world order" and the Wahabi doctrine of new Islam. Islam is a religion and we have freedom of religion in this country. Indonesia prides itself not only for being a country with the world's biggest Muslim population, but also for its tolerant brand of Islam. It also relates to the ability and willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple ethnicities . Unlike most countries that have an army, in the case of Pakistan, the army has a country. <CN> Apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? So surely a country without Islam would be less 'religously' diverse?
<HS> Islam is totalitarian: Muslims want to invade every country. If we want to live in a multicultural world we need some countries without Islam. <knowl> But it must do so without making the mistake of mimicking its way of thinking. Muslims, it is well known, identify all prescripts of Islamic Law totally and vehemently with the Command of God... The smallest details of daily life are subject to the provisions of Islamic law, not excluding personal hygiene and metabolism. Indeed, simply presenting doctrinal Sharia without camouflage, and then demonstrating how Muslims, overwhelmingly, continue to cherish the application of this ancient system of religious totalitarianism, shatters the prevailing, rigidly enforced Western apologetic narrative. European countries have a long history of wooing one another's rich with offers of bigger salaries and smaller government. <CN> I thought 'Totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the STATE, rather than to any particular faith. So no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'.
<HS> Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away! <knowl> For Muslims all over the world, this will lead to the needed reform of Muslim people and Muslim thinking--and it will be reform from within, not one imposed from outside. Rather than being introduced as part of a comprehensive treatment that includes psychotherapy, it is often used in its place. I kept injecting despite losing friends - though difficulty socializing was one of the main reasons I took drugs in the first place. In a November survey by pollster Emnid, 61% of Germans said Islam doesn't fit in the western world, while 40% said the presence of Muslims made them feel like foreigners in their own country. Change can be mandated, of course; but top-down, fiat-driven change is very unlikely to leave an organization in a powerful place. <CN> What have Muslim people done to you? Would you like to be in their place and be repatriated? These are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences!
<HS> Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away! <knowl> Sabin begins field trials of his vaccine in the Soviet Union. Study after study has found no trace of the virus in CFS patients. In 1990, my mom wrote a letter that said she contracted the virus. The most advanced of the vaccines have been tested only in small clinical trials. Measles is still a big problem in some other parts of the world, and travelers infected abroad can bring the virus into the country and spread it. <CN> Can I suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense.
<HS> Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away! <knowl> will not be deterred... by the efforts of those who find the presence of Muslims in British cultural life offensive. Iran is a major problem if the country gets nuclear weapons and it's desperately trying to. "Some of the people had clothing in their yards they were trying to dry; they are now more sodden.

<HS> Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away! <knowl> Worried about the rising number of Muslim children in our schools? In another seven London council areas, more than a quarter of all school-age children are from Muslim homes. In Tower Hamlets 66 per cent of school-age children are Muslim. The Association of Muslim Schools says there are a total 156 dedicated Muslim schools in the UK, most of them privately-funded. All that said, there is undoubtedly a big problem in the UK housing market. <CN> Given the number of Muslims born in the UK, this statement is a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved.

Romney appeared acutely aware of the perception fueled in part by Rosen's comments that she may be out of touch with American women. In 2012, officials released a composite image of what "Grateful Doe" might look like. Pictured: Garcia and Bob Dylan in the summer of 1987.Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead. It is a reflection, and apparent need, of a generation that has the attention span of a gnat. <CN> As a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many Londoners do not want to do. We should be grateful that our society is still functioning well.
<HS> Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away! <knowl> The problem is that we in journalism invariably focus on Africa's wars, poverty and humanitarian disasters, and aid agencies and academics do the same. Most of the others were escaping dictatorships, wars, and poverty in Eritrea, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan. pic.twitter.com/0GvuVLte2tYou've gotta hand it to the Californians' sense of humor in the face of natural disasters. Millions remain at risk because they live in such desperate poverty. The Japanese Red Cross is helping thousands of survivors in evacuation centers. <CN> People run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. They run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. Pushing them back into their disasters is not humane.

<HS> Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away! <knowl> will not be deterred... by the efforts of those who find the presence of Muslims in British cultural life offensive. In the 15 years I lived in London (I returned home to the United States three years ago), I was constantly struck by the sense of otherness with which many English people regarded Europeans. "It's one of the most successful streets in this neighborhood and the fact that she's celebrating it is a wonderful thing," Singleton said. The rebirth of the dimmer switch is a wonderful thing, says Marlon Lloyd Malcom of Lurot Brand. <CN> In my opinion, many people want to emigrate to London means London is a charming and enjoyable place for living. Isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait?
<HS> Nowadays the big problem in London is the presence of muslims, they must go away! <knowl> Little wonder that the presence of Muslims is generating alarm and almost outright rejection. Many readers complained of the presence of urine and feces on city sidewalks, ubiquitous panhandlers and homeless people, and the high cost of, well, everything. Of course has observed jihadist and kill tens of thousands of people all over the world. The first reason is the radical character of French secularism that has been hardening with the presence of Muslims. Scores of activists are imprisoned in Vietnam on charges relating to freedom of expression, and others complain of intimidation and violence. <CN> Invasion?

And over half of the people who work in this country own or work for a small business. <CN> If we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories of the 1970's, for example, it's a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grandkids as an invasion or a plague, don't you think?
<HS> Our state will become Islamic, a home for Muslims and a prison for those who oppose it. It is the goal of the government! <knowl> Paradoxically, religious freedom for Muslims is in jeopardy today in the United States, while our government condemns the lack of religious freedom in Muslim countries. For many Muslims in America, life is a daily clash between Islamic mores and material temptation. The responses to specific questions showed that a minority of French Muslims favored Islamic traditions over French law. The planning board rejected the application for the mosque in December. Sure, Americans are happy to have Muslims go to their mosques. <CN> Are you forced to pray in a Mosque? Or observe all the rules? As far as I see it, Muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society.
<HS> I think they pray in public only to make us infidels angry, not because it is a fundamental principle of Islam. <knowl> When Sarah Palin said she was taking off the gloves, she wasn't just whistling "Onward, Christian Soldiers. A few years ago, wads of cash started to pop up in red Salvation Army kettles in Minnesota. Bachmann is happy to have a Christian chaplain pray in the name of Jesus in an event where all military are required to attend. Howard Street, the street of the unemployed in San Francisco, California." How can it increase the involvement of women in its higher levels? <CN> Never mind a bit of praying in public, how do we stop the Salvation Army waking us up on a Sunday with 'Onward Christian Soldiers'. A working man deserves a lie-in!
<HS> I think they pray in public only to make us infidels angry, not because it is a fundamental principle of Islam. <knowl> Will this proposal receive a positive response from other Evangelicals, other Christians, and people of other faiths? Invoking President Kennedy, Sebelius called the separation of church and state "a fundamental principle in our unique democracy." "He added: "Our nation is rooted in the Christian faith and that is the basis of welcoming people of other faiths. The Islamic faith is being accommodated while the Christian faith is being marginalized. "Sorry, Islam and other faiths have their basis in human dignity," Hooper said. <CN> How many times have you seen evangelical Christian preachers and followers on the streets most Saturdays in most UK cities? You do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same?
<HS> I think they pray in public only to make us infidels angry, not because it is a fundamental principle of Islam. <knowl> The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. No specific details of the workings of the claimed technology have been made public . David Já, president of the Islamic Community of Angola (ICA), said on Thursday: "We can say that Islam has been banned in Angola. However, the actions of the Pakistani troops are quite the contrary to the tenants of Islam... He is author of A Mosque in Munich, about the rise of radical Islam in the West. <CN> Public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to Islam.
<HS> Because of the Muslims, Britain is no longer the great country of the past! They are a disease! <knowl> We are a great country, we are the fifth largest economy in the world. And I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed. But one thing is certain from these findings  it is still great to live in Britain. Britain is expected to become the most populous EU country by 2060, with 77 million inhabitants. Ajmal Masroor, from the Islamic Society of Britain, said: "Muslim communities are very loyal to this country. <CN> If a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. At least, it will find its way to get stronger.
<HS> Because of the Muslims, Britain is no longer the great country of the past! They are a disease! <knowl> During a recent trip to Great Britain, Jindal was pressed for evidence of Muslim no-go zones, the supposed beachheads of the Islamist invasion. But one thing is certain from these findings  it is still great to live in Britain. We know that in many other countries Muslims have it worse. The religion is the same, but different countries have different names. Economic and political isolation threatened to destroy the newly Protestant country. <CN> No. Having a diverse society is a positive. There is no 'invasion'.
<HS> Because of the Muslims, Britain is no longer the great country of the past! They are a disease! <knowl> have great respect for Muslims, I have many friends that are Muslims. People that live in Great Britain; people that live all over the world were saying Donald Trump is right. We know that in many other countries Muslims have it worse. He went on: When he was talking about Muslims, attacking them ... Nearly twice as many of those surveyed had an unfavorable view of Roma people. <CN> Why are you attacking muslims? Many people come and live in Britain and I do not see why it is a bad thing.
<HS> Because of the Muslims, Britain is no longer the great country of the past! They are a disease! <knowl> It is time for Britain to integrate aspects of Islamic law. "Britain's tolerance of Islamic extremism has prompted calls for a clampdown in recent years. But one thing is certain from these findings  it is still great to live in Britain. People that live in Great Britain; people that live all over the world were saying Donald Trump is right. There has been some debate in the country as to whether to ban the Islamic State's signature flag, for example. <CN> Can I ask you what bad things Islam has brought to us? I cannot name any!
<HS> Muslims use corporal and cruel punishment on people. <knowl> They were happy that more than 3,000 innocent people, including Muslims, were murdered. Civilians are fleeing in panic because these ISIS savages are known to slaughter innocent people. Religious people in general are more proud to be British than those who call themselves atheists or non-believers, the survey by the think tanks Demos said. In many of the world's most beautiful mosques, visiting hours are limited and non-believers must tread wearily. Muslims have lived as minorities in non-Muslim societies since the beginning of Islam — from Christian Abyssinia to imperial China. <CN> Muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers.
<HS> In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm. <knowl> One fountain was exclusively for white people and the other for black people during the segregation era. These suburbs are now entirely Muslim, the catchment areas for the schools with barely a single white face. All of it.became an Internet sensation in May after sharing a bikini photo of herself following her 172-lb. Why would people be angry about Birmingham being described as "totally Muslim"?The residents of Birmingham, like most other people in Britain, tend to speak English. In Detroit, murals decorate a 6-foot-tall concrete wall built in 1941 to separate a new development meant for white people from an existing black neighborhood. <CN> Photo? Evidence? Did you report them? Or just another internet myth.
<HS> In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm. <knowl> Opponents of photo ID warn of potentially hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised voters. Take photos of all voters, including in the photo ID the name of the voter. In 2012, the state announced that it would allow only five kinds of photo ID. A March 2012 Elon University poll of 534 people showed that nearly 75 percent of North Carolina residents supported the state's photo voter ID bill. Virginia requires voters to present one of several forms of identification, not necessarily a photo ID. <CN> If I spray something on a wall and tag it HRH does that make it the law? I am even willing to add a stamp as a photo id. First class of course. There's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish.
<HS> In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm. <knowl> King once detested white people because of his experiences growing up in the segregated South, Rieder says. He said members can also discuss issues that affect white people, such as immigration and affirmative action. These suburbs are now entirely Muslim, the catchment areas for the schools with barely a single white face. King wrote that it was easy for white people to tell blacks that they were moving too fast. That King isn't a dreamer, Rieder says, but someone else: The angry black man who wonders what kind of God some white people follow. <CN> When they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? Why do I feel there is a fuller story here?
<HS> In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm. <knowl> King once detested white people because of his experiences growing up in the segregated South, Rieder says. Those facing charges included some people seen in episodes of the series . The nurses brought me a small white mirror, which I still have. This was the chair that appears in David Hockney's lithograph Mirror, Mirror on the Wall. <CN> Saw that in the Mirror, bit of graffiti sprawled across a wall, hardly a shop sign. Have you nothing better than false news?
<HS> In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm. <knowl> King once detested white people because of his experiences growing up in the segregated South, Rieder says. These suburbs are now entirely Muslim, the catchment areas for the schools with barely a single white face. King wrote that it was easy for white people to tell blacks that they were moving too fast. Roof said he had felt compelled to act because of the way he believed black people treated white people. Roof chuckled during his confession, saying he hadn't gone to another church "because there could be white people there". <CN> Please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred.
<HS> In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm. <knowl> How 5Pointz looked before its owners painted over all of the graffiti early Tuesday morning. They teach people not to vandalize and how to do graffiti art responsibly and with permission. People had taken markers to the signs in tribute: We played by the rules, read one. On 29 October Banksy 's art was displayed in a shop window , unbeknownst to the owners . "Gold Mountain," a North Beach mural depicting Chinese history, had to be repainted when the building owners couldn't keep it free of graffiti. <CN> Try harder next time. It was graffiti, not a sign from the owners.
<HS> In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm. <knowl> White people aren't included," he says in a clip from the new show. King once detested white people because of his experiences growing up in the segregated South, Rieder says. Jose Antonio Vargas issues that challenge in White People, his new MTV documentary about race in America. He said members can also discuss issues that affect white people, such as immigration and affirmative action. King wrote that it was easy for white people to tell blacks that they were moving too fast. <CN> Report to True Vision online. I am sure you know it's illegal to discriminate by colour. But something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story.
<HS> In Birmingham there are Muslims shops that do not serve white people after 8pm. <knowl> You sought clearly to get a laugh from an audience of over 1,000 people because of the colour of his skin. It's actually quite remarkable how many colours human skin can be. Newborns were often selected for assimilation based on the colour of their skin. "The colour change is not caused by pigments in their skin, he adds. "You targeted the victim for no reason other than the colour of his skin. <CN> Judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin.
<HS> In the swimming pool there are baths only for Muslims, I cannot enter. If I, a white men, asked for something like this nobody would allow me. Muslims can do anything they want. <knowl> BOSSES at a community swimming pool have sparked outrage by holding men and women-only sessions - for cultural reasons. An Active Luton spokesman defended the move and explained that on Friday evenings, Inspire offered gender-specific swimming sessions - albeit men had access to the larger competitive pool. The grounds include gardens, a swimming pool and a three-car garage. The grounds include a swimming pool, an outdoor kitchen, decks and patios. The spacious grounds include a swimming pool, terraces and a deep shaded porch. <CN> Men Only' sessions are Friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. So what is this, 'Patriarchal Appeasement'?
<HS> In the swimming pool there are baths only for Muslims, I cannot enter. If I, a white men, asked for something like this nobody would allow me. Muslims can do anything they want. <knowl> The grounds include gardens, a swimming pool and a three-car garage. The grounds include a swimming pool, an outdoor kitchen, decks and patios. The spacious grounds include a swimming pool, terraces and a deep shaded porch. The grounds include a swimming pool and landscaped areas that back to parkland. The property includes a two-bedroom guest house, a swimming pool and a greenhouse. <CN> After checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'Women Only', 'Men Only' and 1 hour a week for 'Muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about.
<HS> The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam. <knowl> The government orchestrates raids and detains and imprisons people who practice these religions. they are not there to change the West cultures and values as some people suggest. Im asking myself, why are people not able to protest peacefully, like they did today in Ankara. In Britain, the government tried to compel our Church to allow gay parents to adopt children through its services. In the last two decades, six heads of government in Israel have failed to achieve a peace settlement, but they were not at fault. <CN> People have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. They are not trying to convert us all, are they? So we should just leave them at peace.
<HS> The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam. <knowl> The government justified by saying that it was an invasion of Angolan culture and a threat to Christian values. Baba Mohammad, an elder patron of Manghopir's shrine, says he believes the Taliban consider the local Sufi community a threat. Some political figures have recently floated the idea of imposing a small levy on the certification of halal food to finance mosques. Mohamed still blames the mosque, I know the imam of that Mosque. Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Opponents of an Islamic community center and mosque planned to be built near ground zero say it would desecrate hallowed ground. <CN> What do you mean by 'islamized'? If mosques are built in some areas, I do not see this as a threat but as representation of community in those areas?
<HS> The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam. <knowl> These demands are a way of imposing Islam on a secular society. Notes the Commission: The Uzbek government violates the full range of human rights and harshly penalizes individuals for independent religious activity, regardless of their religious affiliation. Mere religious affiliation has weakened for the poor and working class as well. But to defend a distinct cultural Christian identity is to secularize Christianity itself. The imposition of religious dogma in government is by no means a conservative ideal. <CN> We will not know until the next census by recent survey suggests that the UK is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religious affiliation at all.
<HS> The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam. <knowl> The government has been asking lenders about the possibility of submitting tender offers with negative rates at the ministry's short-term special accounts borrowing programme auctions. they are not there to change the West cultures and values as some people suggest. Will the next government that emerges from the tumult in Egypt be Islamic or Islamist? The government justified by saying that it was an invasion of Angolan culture and a threat to Christian values. The upshot is that, according to the Kosovo government, 300 Kosovars have traveled to fight in Syria or Iraq, mostly to join the Islamic State. <CN> Are you suggesting that the 'Prevent' programme is about appeasement to Islam, Hadaway bonnie lad.
<HS> The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam. <knowl> The United States government expelled much of the faculty in 2004 as part of the crackdown on extremist Islamic rhetoric. Without the Saudi presence over the decades, might a more progressive and accommodating Islam, reflecting immigrants' Moroccan roots, have taken hold in Brussels? ISNA, CAIR, and their ilk are headed mostly by men who came to this country since the 1960's immigration policy opened the doors to people from the Muslim world, and by white converts, often women, who follow a socially conservative brand of Islam. But the Saudi government would find it extraordinarily difficult to shed or soften its ideology, especially after the landmark year of 1979.In Tehran that year, the Iranian revolution brought to power a radical Shiite government, symbolically challenging Saudi Arabia, the leader of Sunnism, for leadership of global Islam. Islam in America is trying to create a new cultural matrix that can survive in the broader context of America, said Prof. Sherman Jackson, who teaches Arabic and Islamic law at the University of Michigan. <CN> Why would you say that? British government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every Islam or any immigrant.
<HS> The Muslims are imposing their culture in the U.K and the government allows it by submitting to Islam. <knowl> Parties who submit to such courts agree, as a matter of contract, to accept their decisions. The governments of post-Soviet Central Asia receive some of the worst rankings for religious freedom in the world. The government of Uzbekistan takes a similar approach, and has imprisoned thousands of Muslims for participating in illegal groups. Fitch Ratings believes policy makers would act cautiously, with careful consideration of the impact and with an appropriate transitional period. With Reyes, slugger Hanley Ramirez and an imposing rotation, the Marlins sank instead of steam-rolling to the top of the division. <CN> What type of whmis are you talking about? Laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> Instead, she said she was satisfied with the level of Islam being provided at the school, alongside teaching of other religions. She and others say more education about Native American cultures is needed. "The diverse society has allowed us to expand our minds to other cultures. I also heard that Muslims were biased against other religions," Prince told Al Jazeera. In your minds, you're the righteous heroes, but to most others you're just ignorant. <CN> The only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. This is not a society where I want to live.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> Children learn through play — through puzzles, games, and questions and answers. Children do not necessarily learn from every television show they watch. Now, our children enjoy deep, meaningful, child-focused learning experiences each day. He got extra cash for children with learning disabilities and other issues. By this time , children learn new vocabulary mostly through conversation and reading . <CN> Why? What is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice?
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> Bangladesh is officially secular but has seen a rise in extremist Islamic ideologies in recent years. The pieces mock aspects of Islam and fellow bloggers said Rahman did not believe in any organised religion. They then proceeded to recite some awful jokes written by children. Rita Swan, Children's Healthcare Is a Legal DutyMedical neglect may not be as sensational as other religion-related abuses but it has been just as deadly. Stephen Jutras, left, and William Jackson Harper in "The Children of Vonderly. <CN> Only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. I wonder why?
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> I don't know how these children in the school will continue, knowing what happened. Catherine Gordon has had a Christmas tree in her classroom at Bangor High School for 30 years. Two adults were looking after 23 children, six of them under 1 year old, in that Bristow home. It's a public health issue, because the diseases contracted by unvaccinated children are a threat to the community. The Melbourne-based study has already transformed the lives of many of the children who took part in the clinical trial. <CN> Maybe if you'd learned about Islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you and you'd be more tolerant of it.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> Laws and cultural norms have shifted to create new opportunities, better access and a relatively more inclusive society. Instead, children are ordered to sit quietly at their desks, listen to scripted learning programs and focus on academic skills. Drill children until they are skilled at taking tests; kill their joy of learning and their curiosity about the world. During the election campaign , she promised to make Singapore a more inclusive society by representing the disabled and special needs communities . The idea was to bring these gorgeous kids into a community that didn't know them and create a more inclusive society. <CN> Learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? I strongly disagree.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> I care deeply about the care of children and that's what I wanted to get across. Parents are busy people, often sleep-deprived, particularly when your children outnumber the number of parents that are out and about. Oh, and suppose you believe that the Fed's actions did help avert what would otherwise have been a fiscal crisis. And now Bernanke is suggesting that the Fed start purchases of long-term government bonds as a way to reduce long-term market rates. and I would never wish this on children or their parents. <CN> Do you have any evidence that Islam is being forced fed? I did not think so.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> Folks, our public schools have become indoctrination centers - promoting Islam and marginalizing every other religion. Islam within itself, Islam itself means peace, the government video states. Instead, she said she was satisfied with the level of Islam being provided at the school, alongside teaching of other religions. I wouldn't want Prothero — or anyone else — teaching religion to my children. The idea of children praying in a mosque on a school-sponsored trip raised fears that the program was forcing religion on unsuspecting children. <CN> Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> And yet just a few states away public school children are learning the Islamic profession of faith. The Islamic faith is being accommodated while the Christian faith is being marginalized. Many Islamic regimes also taxed Jews and Christians for their faiths, he said, but on the balance, Islam didn't gain converts through coercion. Porterfield and Ellis also took issue with the white-washing of the Islamic faith. Already, several thousands of Americans of all faiths have endorsed the True Islam campaign. <CN> Learning about and respecting all faiths, including Islam, is not nonsense.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> "Christianity and Islam could both be growing at the expense of other religions. So why didn't representatives from other churches or other religions stand up for the children suffering from measles in Philadelphia? Religions that try to thrive by insulting other religions are insecure. Early in first grade, one of the nuns advised our class not to associate with children who attended other schools and believed other religions. Let us teach our children to treat others with friendship, respect, love, and admiration. <CN> A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> It's not that we lack imagination or love for our young children. On the bright side, the panic about Ebola spread exactly as fast as Ebola didn't. On the bright side, Beyonce stood onstage with the word FEMINIST in big letters behind her. There's little angst over the many men who choose not to have children, and little social condemnation. And the increase in young children is largely a Hispanic story, driving 70 percent of the growth in children younger than 5. Forty-five percent of U.S. children younger than 5 are minorities. <CN> Maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant and understanding people. Look at the bright side!
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> Other tweets tell of a normal life of a little child. With a photo of her holding missing tooth, she tweets: Good afternoon. The result is that children of divorce often live in poorer housing with less money. Have already received hundreds of tweets asking for a 'Married with Children' reunion, he added. A user called eirelaw commented on the presence of Jackson's children at the service. <CN> The real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this!
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> Children use words differently for objects , spatial relations and actions . Before children are able to read on their own , children can learn from others reading to them . In early word learning , infants build their vocabulary slowly . Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners , they seem to tell us little about children 's capacities at the start of word learning . " One " and " two " are the first number words that children learn between the ages of one and two . <CN> At most, children are just learning more about different religions. You are using very strong and unnecessary words here.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> The school pointed out that it was a make-believe scenario - and no child was actually forced to convert to the Islamic faith. Unbaptised children are unable to get places in over-subscribed local schools, forcing their parents to look further afield from their homes in ever-widening circles. "Kagin believes parents are wrong to baptize their children before they are able to make their own choices, even slamming some religious education as "child abuse." Things such as this are not compatible with Islam and thus worrisome to Muslim parents. It sets criteria for admitting children and recruiting teachers, and determines religious education and instruction. <CN> No child is 'forced fed' Islam. Parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education.
<HS> Our children are taught Islamic ideologies. It is awful! <knowl> and I would never wish this on children or their parents. She hopes people who voted leave have ill children who can't get treatment. Later, she waited in his office with her other children and their 103-degree temperatures. I care deeply about the care of children and that's what I wanted to get across. Probably when she was pregnant that awful hot summer and the first of three children took his time being born. <CN> What do you mean by being forced fed? I haven't seen anything like this.
<HS> Muslims have killed Christians and Jews for years, enslaved Africans and caused terror. We must not forget it. <knowl> For Christians, Jesus Christ has told us to go out and preach. Jews don't like Muslims Christians don't like Muslims Chinese don't like muslims. They are particularly fearful for the key city of Sadad, where Christians lived peacefully with Muslims for centuries. Declarations of jihad have been made for purposes of violence against Christians, Jews, Americans, British and fellow Muslims hundreds of times. <CN> Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born. All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born, Tyson said. Although Christians are not prohibited from privately celebrating, they are warned that their Christmas activities should not be "disclosed or displayed publicly to Muslims." The most populous country in Africa, Nigeria is almost evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. Although Bethlehem is the main focus of Christmas, we in Jerusalem arrange Christmas activities too. <CN> Christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these Muslims that are offended by it? Sounds like fake news to me.
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> Despite its name, the Defend Christmas Freedom Hotline won't be limited to people celebrating Christmas, Smith said. In predominantly Muslim countries, the celebration can last for three days. The whole Christmas stress, build up and celebration just goes past me. Christmas for me is about celebration, thanks, reflection and, of course, presents!! <CN> Have you actually spoken with Muslim about this? Do people celebrating Christmas actually offend them? I would be keen to know.
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> Adding a holiday celebration doesn't help: holidays, especially Christmas, make people sad. My family is in France and on Christmas Eve, they will be celebrating Christmas without me. "Celebrating Christmas with Joey, surrounded by family," Rory wrote in a post on the country duo's Facebook page. HOW CELEBRITIES ARE CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS"They've spent a lot of time together and really enjoy each other's company. In predominantly Muslim countries, the celebration can last for three days. <CN> You know, I spoke with Muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating Christmas. Such a relief isn't it?
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born. All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born, Tyson said. A Christmas tree is a symbol of Christmas - and a secular one at that. My family is in France and on Christmas Eve, they will be celebrating Christmas without me. What's wrong with celebrating the birthday of the most famous Jew ever to walk the Earth?Besides, tons of Jews are already celebrating Christmas anyway. <CN> I have never seen so many people celebrating Christmas this year and as far as I know none of Muslims were offended. So, what are you talking about?
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> In predominantly Muslim countries, the celebration can last for three days. It marks the birthday of the prophet Jesus, revered by Muslims. All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born. For Christians, Jesus Christ has told us to go out and preach. <CN> Muslims 'believe' in Jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either.
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> When I was young, my family celebrated Christmas very literally as Jesus' birthday. That's clear when Christmas trees fill homes and apartments in Japan, a country where 2% of the population is Christian. IndiaWhile July 30 is the official, recently-declared United Nation's "International Day of Friendship," India celebrates it a few weeks later. The violence captured the attention of some high profile figures in the U.S., where Pride Week celebrations are also under way:Istanbul? It marks the birthday of the prophet Jesus, revered by Muslims. <CN> Prophet Muhammad: 'The dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is Jesus, the son of Mary.' - Muslims love Jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth?
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> This fear is, in part, behind the rising anti-Muslim sentiment in the country. With candy canes, snowflakes and Christmas trees galore, the sweaters are truly a sight to behold. While we can't be too sure of the famous inventor behind the stripes, we know one thing: Christmas time without candy canes would in fact be no Christmas at all. Where Do Candy Canes Come From?Where do candy canes come from?Every year around Christmas time, we see them. See how all the stars are celebratingHow the stars are celebrating ChristmasHow the stars are celebrating ChristmasBest Christmas present ever! <CN> Christmas isn't banned, you do not have to say 'Winter Celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). This is all manufactured outrage to create anti-Muslim sentiment. Chill.
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born. Although Christians are not prohibited from privately celebrating, they are warned that their Christmas activities should not be "disclosed or displayed publicly to Muslims." All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born, Tyson said. This fear is, in part, behind the rising anti-Muslim sentiment in the country. The most populous country in Africa, Nigeria is almost evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. <CN> Muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by Islamophobic hatred.
<HS> We should pay attention to not offend Muslims while celebrating Christmas in our country. <knowl> In predominantly Muslim countries, the celebration can last for three days. As much of the world gears up for Christmas, there's one country where citizens could risk time in prison if they are caught celebrating: the tiny, oil-rich sultanate of Brunei.

Inverness is home to a few hundred Muslims, although numbers fluctuate with short-term employment contracts in the NHS and other industries. At first, I thought I was the only Muslim engaging in this folly, and I am reluctant to express it lest right-wing zealots try to use "Muslim" as a smear and cite my theory as proof of an Islamic traitor in the White House or some such nonsense. Once you have a Muslim parent, especially a dad, you're in. "Well, I know he's not really Muslim," I would quickly add. <CN> Most Muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the NHS to be worried about such nonsense.
<HS> Muslims are invading London. There are more Muslims than Londoners in London. #londinistan #LondonHasFallen. <knowl> London is in the midst of the Industrial Revolution in Sydicate. With the Industrial Revolution came a new kind of city, vastly bigger than any since ancient Rome. In the first podcast, Rifkin explains exactly how the Third Industrial Revolution will change our daily lives. Speaking at the launch of London Technology Week, Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said these forecasts were realistic. Hence they seek to explain events like the Industrial Revolution in terms of changes in institutions, not people. <CN> London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, Saxon invasions.

We must fight. <knowl> US president should intercede in ANY religious war of another country. The shame is, most of you really believe you are Christians. Iraq a mostly Christian BEFORE the Muslim religion was even invented. They stand by their political ideals at the expense of the country.

<HS> Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight. <knowl> At least then we can get rid of the christian 'sharia' that has been imposed on us. After decades of civil war, many Colombians have questioned whether Farc fighters should be allowed back into society. Of course the howls from the christians would be the most deafening, because they, more than muslims, are trying to impose their church doctrines on the rest of us. I have a lot of friends and my friends have enemies, so I won some enemies as well, says Stendal. If Christians war with homosexuals, we're ignoring the majority -- all the people somewhere on the continuum between the two groups. <CN> You should ask people what religions they belong to. Most people would say they do not belong to any! Then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society?
<HS> Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight. <knowl> Scholars, international organizations and a host of Western governments believe the atrocities amount to genocide. Wars of independence became wars of peoples and wars of religion. "Those are the enemies of the people and the enemies of God. Over the past century, all Turkish governments have vehemently rejected the term genocide. And of course, from time to time, everyone took a turn persecuting the Jews. <CN> I'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. Do you want to also start a genocide? How are you different from the people you accuse?

They even depend on traditional Islamic principles such as ijtihad to, some may say, do away with other traditional Islamic principles. The Egyptian government is filled with cowards bent on letting Christians suffer at the hands of the majority religion of Islam. The problem seemed to be that it was seen as politically incorrect to take too much notice of Christians suffering in case it was interpreted as casting a slur on the whole of Islam. In November of last year, she told a gathering of the Lutheran Church that Christianity was the most persecuted religion in the world. <CN> What you said is an extreme case. One of the Islamic principles is to respect human dignity. Islam condemns violence.

She currently is a leader of a campaign for Christians threatened with genocide by ISIS. The US government acknowledged the ISIS genocide suffered by these Christians, Yizidis and other minorities, last March. This is the latest in a string of brutal attacks committed by ISIS against Christian and other minorities. The announcement came amid mounting international pressure to declare the acts against Christians and other religious minorities as genocide. <CN> Something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide.
<HS> Christians have fought for lots of years against Muslims, we also stopped a genocide. We are enemies. But now it seems that our government forgot about this. This is a war! We must fight. <knowl> In the comparatively undamaged parts of the city that had long been held by the government, restaurants were thronged by Christians late into the night. Amid the chaos, some politicians on both sides are scrambling to make a deal. So -- and we're also leaving behind in practical terms an awful lot of civilians. Many backers of the nine-year war worry the situation on the ground is worsening. Decades of war, emigration and relatively low birth rates have weakened Christians politically as well. <CN> Why would you think it is a war? Can't we deal with it peacefully? War cannot solve problems but create chaos.
<HS> Nowadays celebrating Easter as a Christian is impossible because it could offend Muslims. <knowl> As people around the globe mark holy week, Pope Benedict XVI celebrated his first Easter Sunday as pontiff. Even many secular Muslims fast or pursue good works throughout Ramadan. Saudi Arabia threatens to expel even non-Muslim expatriates seen violating Ramadan. Many Muslim communities also hold Ramadan fund-raising drives for charitable causes. A few Christians and people of other faiths joining Muslims in fast. <CN> Yes, we are allowed to celebrate Easter as Muslims are allowed to celebrate Ramadan. No one is offending anyone here, why is there a need to create division?
<HS> Nowadays celebrating Easter as a Christian is impossible because it could offend Muslims. <knowl> Earlier the pontiff celebrated the Holy Thursday Mass that marks the start of the Easter celebrations. Easter is the most holy of days for Christians, the day we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Everybody knows that Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus on December 25th, he wrote.

<HS> We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims. <knowl> They were gullible into believing that all religions preach only peace. God created them just for the people who are in paradise. Islamic scholars say banning non-Muslims from using Allah is unique to Malaysia. In another, the Koran tells Muslims to "fight those who believe not in Allah. I do believe in forcing people to confront issues instead of going into denial. <CN> Actually the Quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like Christianity its only God /Allah that should judge.
<HS> We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims. <knowl> The user said the dog-familiarization event was part of a Jewish agenda to Christianise Muslim-Malaysians through subtle measures. "No, it is not, it is a reaction to the terrorist attacks by the mad dog muslims that have infected the civilized world. The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends. . . . What matters is not what Muslims tell us they stand for. They are being advised by people who hate Muslims and Islam .... <CN> Do you think a Muslim would forget to capitalise the I in Islam?
<HS> We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims. <knowl> The response from participants in the dog-walking group — and their dog companions — was very different. There is still a lot more dog walking that could be done among dog owners, Dr. Reeves said. Called the Power of Pets, the programs include dog run/walks, dog yoga and other dog fair activities. "To help dogs adjust to loose lead walking, Wilson introduces exercises that make her the center of attention. Getting a dog increased average walking by about 30 minutes a week, compared with those who didn't own dogs. <CN> I do not see why that would be offensive.? Please do walk your dog, it needs exercise.
<HS> We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims. <knowl> There is still a lot more dog walking that could be done among dog owners, Dr. Reeves said. The TV show is also about rescue dogs and how bright they shine. A study of 41,500 California residents also looked at walking among dog and cat owners as well as those who didn't have pets. Before getting a dog, the new dog owners had clocked about 89 minutes of weekly walking, but dog ownership boosted that number to 130 minutes a week. Not only are dog owners more likely to take regular walks, but new research shows that dog walkers are more active over all than people who don't have dogs. <CN> That was from a reality tv show maybe if I am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through?
<HS> We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims. <knowl> Re: Picking up guys who love dogs: Just walk around Old Town Alexandria on a weekend evening. If you have a dog, go walk the dog, or if you have a kid go walk the kid, Ambrosio added. Cesar Millan weighed in on the White House dog this week, saying he shouldn't be leading the President around when they walk. Hot dogs play a key role in film, television and literature. He is definitely a different dog to the last few weeks. <CN> Great excuse to get out of it, wish I'd thought of that.
<HS> We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims. <knowl> The idea here is that dog owners have to wake up a little earlier each day to walk their furry friends. If you have a dog, go walk the dog, or if you have a kid go walk the kid, Ambrosio added. And by catwalk, we mean the mere moments it takes a dog to walk past a cat of any size or demeanor. This leads Finn to wish that the Lich had never existed . Once an hour, walk the halls to get your blood flowing. <CN> Wish I could believe everything I read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in.
<HS> We cannot even take the dog for a walk, we could offend Muslims. <knowl> It will, on the other hand, make them more broken and fearful, and less trusting. Many people in the dog-walking group stopped using canes and walkers. But on closer analysis, the new dog owners had been laggards before getting a dog, walking about 24 percent less than other people without dogs. She saw (the suspect) pull a lighter away and walk away, the source said. But there were also other subtle indicators of improvement among the dog-walking group. <CN> Because throw away comments on reality TV are always true? I think you need to be less trusting and check your sources.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> He also threatened to attack more schools and take additional girls. The outrageous threat means the girls' parents' worst fears could be realized. Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds more — girls, boys, women and young men. Malala was then shot, as were two other girls who survived the attack. Nigeria's police have said more than 300 girls-- ages 16 through 18-- were abducted. <CN> Girls and women do not face a bigger threat from Muslim's than from people of any other faith. Maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> "And there are situations where children, particularly the girls who are the products of those relations, are then forced to have sexual relations with the same family members. In Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country in the world, only 16 percent of Muslims favor such a penalty. There is a lot of sexual violence against these women and girls, I met individuals who are subjected to this. Iraqi women can divorce more easily than women in other predominantly Muslim countries, thanks to laws that predated the new Islamic government. Imams must become advocates for women: As a deeply religious society, Afghanistan must solve its problems within a framework of Muslim beliefs. <CN> The majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are Muslim. It is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're Muslim or not.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> Out of 77 recent convictions for grooming, rape and other predatory sex crimes, 67 involved Pakistani men. Their whole project was conceived in order to highlight the more benign, moderate side of Islam and build bridges with other faiths. The other primary form of prostitution of children is " survival sex " . Some people travel to foreign countries to engage in child sex tourism . Despite the country's constitutional commitment to freedom of faith, religious minorities have complained in recent years of a creeping Islamization that they believe has strained Indonesia's social fabric. <CN> You see to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in?
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> Islamic State have clearly threatened British citizens and they've said they want to attack the UK, he said. The Muslim Council of Britain are the self-appointed leaders of the Muslim community in the UK. Here are the top five countries where British citizens live:Have something to add to this story? Clusters of women from mainland Europe have travelled to Syria after attending Islamic classes in mosques - from France a group of Chechen women emigrated together - but British women have tended to go alone. The NHS, one of the biggest employers of Muslims in the UK, said trusts determined policy individually in accordance with the Equality Act. <CN> I do not know if it counts as invasion when lots of Muslims in the UK are British citizens and were born here.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> Iraqi women can divorce more easily than women in other predominantly Muslim countries, thanks to laws that predated the new Islamic government. Nigerian women are already second-class citizens in their own country, according to the Nigerian Constitution, said Weate. The three women were arrested in March, and the group said the two others have since fled the country. Some women enslaved by the Islamic State were forced to undergo grim procedures even after they escaped the jihadists' clutches. All three women were convicted in August of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred and sentenced to two years in prison. <CN> There are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> A review of the book shows there is balanced attention given to the beliefs of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. The differences between the two main branches of Islam are often compared to those between Protestants and Catholics in the Christian world. The Church of God and Saints of Christ synthesizes rituals from both Judaism and Christianity . "There's a difference in Islam that does not apply to Judaism and Christianity and other religions. The Yazidis are an ancient people, followers of a unique religion that blends elements of Islam, Judaism and Christianity with even more ancient practices, including sun worship. <CN> There is a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of Islam just like Christianity and Judaism.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> The solution, he suggested, was striving for a truer Islamic society. "Every day, women's footsteps can be seen advancing more in society," she said. The poll highlighted a mixed picture for women's rights in other Arab Spring countries. Nigerian women are already second-class citizens in their own country, according to the Nigerian Constitution, said Weate. "From what I have heard, Angola is the first country in the world that has decided to ban Islam," said Elias Isaac, country director of the Open Society Initiative of Southern Africa (Osisa). <CN> People invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. Doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that I am familiar with.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> But why is it left to western organisations like HRW to blow the whistle on violence against women in countries where Islamic fundamentalists hold sway? Or gay men pimping and trafficking women?There is a problem of misogyny among gay men. Achieving equality for women has yet to become an urgent political issue in the United States. On June 6, the Afghan government officially accused the Taliban of poisoning hundreds of girls across the country. Government figures for 2008 said 43,000 women were arrested for clothing-related offenses in the capital alone. <CN> I am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogyny as an exclusively Islamic issue.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> The government then requested more concrete proof in the form of a video, which was then sent. Nigerian women are already second-class citizens in their own country, according to the Nigerian Constitution, said Weate. Some women enslaved by the Islamic State were forced to undergo grim procedures even after they escaped the jihadists' clutches. But less than a year later, the state government abandoned the process after declaring it had made the necessary changes to safeguard women. The Islamic insurgency has forced some 750,000 people, including hundreds of thousands of farmers, to flee their homes, raising fears of a food shortage. <CN> Why do you link rapist crimes and Muslim people? Do you have any proof for that?
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> In fact, while everything from attire to alcohol consumption is blamed when women are raped, military sexual assault statistics show that men in the military are at a slightly greater risk of sexual assault than women. And indeed, studies show that a small percentage of men are responsible for most sexual assaults. We also named and exposed the hidden epidemic of physical and sexual violence towards women and children. After all, the only one in control of whether a sexual assault is attempted is the perpetrator. We know that anyone from a nun to a soldier can be a victim of sexual assault — including men. <CN> Don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by Muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics)
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> We met many other Yazidi women who were captured by Islamic State. Politicians must know from their own experience and that of family, friends and constituents that the NHS is awash with shocking waste, inefficiency and - all too often - incompetence and neglect. Malala symbolizes millions of Pakistani women who are deprived of basic education and equal work opportunities. His authoritarian government has repeatedly expressed concern over the rise of Islam, linking it to extremism. Healthy Muslim men and women are required to fast during the month according to Islamic teachings. <CN> And if all Muslims were to leave, women and girls would still be harmed - most of it comes from family friends, work places, people and institutions and of course we'd have no NHS or train service.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> Besides, Saudi Arabia is one country out of 57 Muslim nations. Moreover, of the 10 bottom-ranking countries in the World Economic Forum's report on women's rights, nine are majority Muslim. In late 2003, Khanam had made international headlines with the announcement that she intended to build a women's mosque in a country where women are banned from most Muslim places of worship. The German government is preparing legislation to outlaw child marriage, an accepted practice among the country's more than 1 million Muslim refugees. We met many other Yazidi women who were captured by Islamic State. <CN> Because Victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? That was when there were no Muslims in the country. Are we really much better now? #metoo?
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> Nigerian women are already second-class citizens in their own country, according to the Nigerian Constitution, said Weate. Some women enslaved by the Islamic State were forced to undergo grim procedures even after they escaped the jihadists' clutches. Otherwise, disallowing sport for women inside the country is still a violation of the Olympic charter, which bans gender discrimination. Women's advocates noted that Attar did her training outside Saudi Arabia and said it was important that women living in the country, which is governed by Islamic law, be given similar opportunities to participate in sport. Under Hamas, there has been mounting social pressure on women to cover up in the traditional Islamic dress of long robes and headscarves. <CN> Easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> She will be on the sex offenders' register for ten years. One went to prison; the other was put on the sex offenders register. On returning to Britain, Glitter was placed on the sex offenders register for life. The women will be sentenced in January with the court ordering them to sign the sex offenders' register. Esnee, who cried throughout the hearing, will sign the sex offenders register for seven years. <CN> Even though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in 2017. Stop blaming others and help our girls and women.
<HS> Women and girls are harmed by Islamic that were allowed to enter in our country by our government. <knowl> In addition, social media users posting on topics such as sexism may face vitriolic abuse from trolls. What steps do you think India should take to make tangible progress towards protecting women from sexual harassment and abuse? Photograph: AlamyOver the past week, the Everyday Sexism Project has received an unprecedented number of stories from women experiencing harassment in the street. In 54% of cases the women say the harasser was a colleague. "They (men) are not taught to respect women right from the house. <CN> And what do girls and women have to say about it? I suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism.
<HS> Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions. <knowl> Quran (2:244) - "Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things. <CN> The Yorkshire Ripper' said God told him to commit his atrocities. In neither case is this a justification. Individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause.
<HS> Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions. <knowl> Yes, says ISIS.Can you have sex with them, even prepubescent girls? This is what makes the Quran's verses of violence so dangerous. Alternative actions are fasting for two consecutive months or feeding hungry people. Time and again, the group cites the Quran and its view of Sharia law. The idea that ISIS is kidnapping, selling and raping women and children is hardly surprising. <CN> I cannot believe it! Looks like another scammy news which is actually not true.
<HS> Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions. <knowl> Rimsha Masih, a Christian girl accused of blasphemy sits in helicopter after her release from jail in Rawalpindi. The pastor behind a public Quran burning said he will cancel his plans if he receives a phone call from the White House. Chishti wasn't certain that simply burning pages with texts from the Quran would be enough to convict Rimsha on blasphemy charges, police said. Far from being mere history or theological construct, the violent verses of the Quran have played a key role in very real massacre and genocide. Instead of spreading the Quran's message of peace, they are spreading their own message of hatred — just as Jones has twisted the Bible's teachings of peace into a message of hatred. <CN> That is a sad tragedy. However, the message from Quran is misunderstood. Instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'.
<HS> Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions. <knowl> I sincerely hope that they will not take such unacceptable actions. His actions should not be identified with the West or Christianity. Yes, says ISIS.Can you have sex with them, even prepubescent girls? Alternative actions are fasting for two consecutive months or feeding hungry people. Time and again, the group cites the Quran and its view of Sharia law. <CN> Rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. This is an abhorrent individual.
<HS> Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions. <knowl> I will respond the way the Quran instructs me to: by asking for proof of their claim. The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule. <CN> There is never justification for rape. Individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. They carry the blame.
<HS> Some Muslims recited the Quran while raping a girl because it validates their actions. <knowl> Quran (2:244) - "Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things. "Quran (4:95) - "Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Is it then they who will win?"Quran (25:52) - "Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness..." "Strive against" is Jihad - obviously not in the personal context. <CN> This is a very sad story! But every Muslim person I know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the Qu'ran.
<HS> Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children. <knowl> In addition, the same survey showed many more Muslim men (70%) than Muslim women (54%) think marrying a non-Muslim is acceptable. Muslim women living in non-Muslim majority nations frequently lack intellectually and professionally equal Muslim partners. In this rubric, the majority, non-radical Muslim populace has somehow compromised Islam to become moderate. No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim. Female recruits are the morality enforcers, the propagandists, even the overseers of rape against captured non-Muslim women. <CN> Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-Muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority.
<HS> Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children. <knowl> Yet when Muslims are the victims of such crimes, the same sense of outrage is not visible. They accused Muslim men of coercing Hindu women into love in order to convert them to Islam. Islamic clerics, doctors, nurses, women, children, etc. -- you name any type of Muslim, and al Qaeda has butchered them. In many ways, intimate social engagement between men and women is pregnant, if one may put it thus, with sexual potential. The report says the tale of indiscriminate terrorist violence in New York "brings into focus some of the worst American fears - that is, Muslims or Arabs attacking the country, murdering men, women and children ... and 'attacking our way of life'. <CN> This is a sad matter, but not all Muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are Muslims.
<HS> Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children. <knowl> It seems the world wakes up only when Jews in their own defense -- defending their men, women and children -- are forced to kill Muslims and Palestinians. They accused Muslim men of coercing Hindu women into love in order to convert them to Islam. Muslim children in the United States aren't sheltered from the vitriol against their faith and communities happening every day. In many ways, intimate social engagement between men and women is pregnant, if one may put it thus, with sexual potential. The Koran effectively outlaws the practice by frowning upon meetings between single men and women; traditionally, Muslim communities have relied on arranged marriages. <CN> This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?
<HS> Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children. <knowl> But they are more often men than women, and they're getting younger. Dads Paternity Leave — for a Year!For starters, men are spending more time with their children while they are young. In many ways, intimate social engagement between men and women is pregnant, if one may put it thus, with sexual potential. The Koran effectively outlaws the practice by frowning upon meetings between single men and women; traditionally, Muslim communities have relied on arranged marriages. Kawthar Ben Salem, a spokeswoman for the Union of Muslims of the Alpes-Maritimes, said that Muslim funerals were being held for at least 30 of those who died during the Bastille Day attack, including men, women and children. <CN> Did you miss 'Some.' from the beginning of this Tweet?
<HS> Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children. <knowl> Most of the women confront verbal abuse on a daily basis, with a lot of the abuse coming from Muslims. The need for men and women to have children, bring them up and look after one another is much more important. In many ways, intimate social engagement between men and women is pregnant, if one may put it thus, with sexual potential. The Koran effectively outlaws the practice by frowning upon meetings between single men and women; traditionally, Muslim communities have relied on arranged marriages. How do you view women as being treated -- Muslim countries. <CN> I'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a Pakistani Muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly Muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue.
<HS> Muslims terrorize our women and they will always do it, e.g. In Oxford today. They are nasty men that sexualize children. <knowl> "Our aim was to protect children who were victims of, or might be at risk of, sexual exploitation. Prostitution of children or child prostitution is prostitution involving a child , and it is a form of commercial sexual exploitation of children . According to the International Labour Office in Geneva , prostitution of children and child pornography are two primary forms of child sexual exploitation , which often overlap . "And we have good legislation like the Protection of Children and Sexual and Prevention of Sexual Offences Act 2005."Frankly, it's not being used. As an alternative , they use the terms " prostituted children " and " the commercial sexual exploitation of children " . <CN> I feel your anger. The often ignored fact is that around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. Besides, most of people convicted of child abuse offences were white men. Sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented.

<HS> Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion. <knowl> That law mandates long prison sentences for child rapists and molesters. Islam within itself, Islam itself means peace, the government video states. Islam brings nothing but peace if you truly look into it. As "Talking Points" stated last week most Muslims are peaceful people. But if you see a Muslim man doing something, their religion is blamed when Islam brings nothing but peace when you truly look into it. <CN> Why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? I am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful.
<HS> Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion. <knowl> Religious surveillance of Muslim communities will one day join this tragic, shameful legacy. The theocratic ideology of Islamism thrives on division, polarization and claims of Muslim victimhood. We cannot have an opposition between the Islamized part of the population and mainstream society. The Dar al-Islam movement of primarily African American Muslims sprang up in New York. Islamism, by contrast, is the desire to impose a single version of Islam on an entire society. <CN> There is already work going within Muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on.
<HS> Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion. <knowl> Saima Sheikh is media communications leader for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. But, that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. In fact, the American Muslim community is the most diverse Muslim community in the world. Now, Islam and Muslims are regular topics on talk shows and in headlines, often in a negative light. Islam complains about drone attacks when the Quran says families of the innocents harmed can take a proper revenge. <CN> Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly.
<HS> Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion. <knowl> This is NOT about religion, not about Islam, not even about Muslims. "Talking Points" well understands that for centuries Muslims coexisted peacefully with other religions. "We shall continue the anti-terrorism war, this attack makes clear that terrorists don't have any respect for the peaceful religion of Islam by killing innocent Muslims." It is also muslims who do not allow the free practice of religion in islamic countries. I have a very good friend who is a member of the Islam faith, he said. <CN> How is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith?
<HS> Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion. <knowl> This is NOT about religion, not about Islam, not even about Muslims. "Talking Points" well understands that for centuries Muslims coexisted peacefully with other religions. The latest example of their peaceful religion is a ruling by the Supreme Court of the UAE allowing beating by men of their wives and children. RMAHDAOUI and the supposed religion of peace are at war against women and children. It is also muslims who do not allow the free practice of religion in islamic countries. <CN> Children are innocent. They do not deserve terrified treatment. Children are the future. We should offer more hope and brightness to our future.
<HS> Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion. <knowl> D. A dynamic person that belongs to the peaceful Islam religion. C. Group of people that belongs to the peaceful Islam religion. They are one of, if not THE most peaceful religions in the world. Papagino May 20th, 2010 12:18 pm ET Ahh, the peaceful religion of Islam. You can preach to me the loving peace of this religion. <CN> Do you think making children suffer will make a religion, Islam, or our world better? I think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse.
<HS> Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time. This way they would be a peaceful religion. <knowl> This is NOT about religion, not about Islam, not even about Muslims. The problem is when you want to be Islamic in a non-Islamic nation. Iran's judiciary uses a strict interpretation of Islamic law in handing down such sentences. It is also muslims who do not allow the free practice of religion in islamic countries. The lessons also taught that Islam was a peaceful religion, court papers say, and that jihad is a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline. <CN> Muslim people I know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in Islam. They talk to their children about that. Thus, they indeed counteract such cases.
<HS> Muslims need to oppose child rapists instead of talking about islam all the time.

"Talking Points" well understands that for centuries Muslims coexisted peacefully with other religions. "We shall continue the anti-terrorism war, this attack makes clear that terrorists don't have any respect for the peaceful religion of Islam by killing innocent Muslims." It is also muslims who do not allow the free practice of religion in islamic countries. Do you think that Islam is an inherently peaceful religion that's been perverted by some? <CN> Have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause?
<HS> Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape. <knowl> Six percent of the men admitted to rape, or attempted rape. It uses illustrations of a male figure to quantify rapists, but the information it cites refers to cases of rape or sexual assault. The average number of rapes for each one of those serial offenders was six. Mr. Krakauer also talked to psychologists and scholars about the trauma of rape, exploring the corrosive toll of sexual assault on a typical American college town. That would mean we approve of violent actions against these rapists at the hands of an unruly mob. <CN> Where did you get this conclusion from? There might be bias in the collecting of information. For example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men.
<HS> Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape. <knowl> Six percent of the men admitted to rape, or attempted rape. Instead, the vast majority of rapes are perpetuated by men who know that what they're doing is wrong. Yet Tracey Vitchers of Students Active for Ending Rape says talking about rape culture has been instrumental to her work. Rape culture theorists dismiss critics who bring up examples of hysteria and false accusations as rape denialists and rape apologists. One major problem with many of these anti-rape products is that they put the onus on women to prevent their own assaults. <CN> This is simply wrong. How can you say such hateful things about millions of people?
<HS> Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape. <knowl> Six percent of the men admitted to rape, or attempted rape. We have a social responsibility, all of us, to stop rape. Nearly A Quarter of Men In Some Asian Countries Admit To Rape)Anti-rape undies aren't even the only innovation in this area. The age-old problem of rape by nonstrangers can only be solved incrementally, he said, and recent improvements in how cases are handled are encouraging. Fully 20% of undergraduate women - again, one in every five university women - report being victims of rape or attempted rape during their time at college. <CN> How many Muslim rapists are there? How many Britain rapists? Compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself!
<HS> Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape. <knowl> Six percent of the men admitted to rape, or attempted rape. This meant the prosecution of rape was near impossible, unless the woman was white, virginal, unmarried (to her rapist) and middle class. The final chapter of the book explores the contemporary anti-rape movement. The age-old problem of rape by nonstrangers can only be solved incrementally, he said, and recent improvements in how cases are handled are encouraging. India's intense public dialogue on rape began in December, after the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in a bus in New Delhi. <CN> How old are you? The first Mosque in the UK was built in 1889!
<HS> You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police. <knowl> The parents from Northlake, Ill., are each charged with two counts of child abuse and five counts of child endangerment. I can see why the victims of child abuse - of child rape as it is better called - are on edge. I also examined a more common class of Google queries: those that include the words âchild abuse" or âchild neglect." He supported calls for much more funding for victims of child abuse. Deborah and Adolfo Gomez, of west suburban Northlake, were arrested Wednesday on two counts of child abuse and five counts of endangering a child. <CN> If you really cared about stopping Child Abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. Looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. Shameful!
<HS> You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police. <knowl> So if the only culture you pay attention to is created by men, or created by white people, you are making an explicit statement about who and what is important. Mr. Mwangi points particularly to the racial inequality in this country, highlighting the staggering rate of incarceration for African-American men, which is nearly six times the rate for white men. This latest study reveals to me that we must pay more attention to the effects of pesticides and that more studies are needed to examine the link between these chemicals and neurodevelopmental disorders. As Americans, we're inundated with images of hungry African children, but what about the plight of children in this country? The video tells the story of a year in the life of a typical English girl in a series of one-second "days," a format popularized by parents filming their children in videos like this one. <CN> Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.
<HS> You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police. <knowl> One of the puzzling questions is why women join misogynistic jihadist groups in the first place, Mauro said. A diminishing number of foreign courts seem to pay attention to the writings of the Supreme Court justices. You go girl!That said, the ad still depicts the stereotype of construction workers shouting at women:dear snickers, your native-ad construction workers are still shouting at women. Because, of course, it confirmed every negative thing certain people think about women like these. On multiple occasions, I've seen Islamic State supporters online make the argument that females who cover their faces and bodies free themselves from the West's objectification of women. <CN> Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate?
<HS> You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police. <knowl> we are looking for him," Paolo Gentiloni, the Italian foreign minister, said. Islamic State commandos attack a restaurant frequented by foreigners in the city of Dhaka in Bangladesh, Amaq, a news agency linked to the Islamic State, reported. The two girls look startingly similar with their blonde hair and wide eyes. The area was the scene last year of the kidnappings of at least two Westerners. <CN> What do you mean by an Islamic area? Why do not we take a look at Dubai, an Islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine.
<HS> You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police. <knowl> But when the girl describes them the social worker switches off with a shrug and says that she can do nothing. The family was being monitored by state social workers since 2011. Pay attention to how the candidates speak and what they say. No social worker today will risk being accused of this crime. <CN> Don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is.
<HS> You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police. <knowl> Strange men approach her and ask her to get into their vehicles. Ms. Cruz went through stretches of getting off drugs, her friends said. But if it is wealthy, then they may have to pay attention. The reasons become clear when the history of world drug policy is understood. <CN> I mean, I would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it?
<HS> Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week. <knowl> They are doing their best to keep the lid on what could become a meltdown of trust between majority populations and Muslim minority communities. The theocratic ideology of Islamism thrives on division, polarization and claims of Muslim victimhood. Many of my fellow Muslims have resisted the call to refute Islamism head-on. Jihadists of all bents seek to create discord, pitting Muslims against non-Muslims in the West and Sunni Muslims against Shiite Muslims in the East. "A quiet man, very shy, asking lots of questions about Islam," Bakri recalled last week. <CN> Child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. Islam does not condone it and Muslims do not accept it.
<HS> Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week. <knowl> The reality, of course, is that most Muslims are neither heroes nor extremists. Western, non-Muslim media portray Muslims as terrorists with very little nuance, says Brown. Most Muslims believe religion, politics should be intertwinedA majority of Muslims surveyed in Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East-North Africa told Pew that religious leaders in their respective countries should have political influence. Spreading the idea of Islam as a violent religion and convincing people that we are in a clash of civilizations is just as central to their agenda. To me, Islam was a peaceful faith, no matter what a handful of violent extremists said. <CN> The media is not ignoring those rape crimes. Those who commit the crimes are extremists. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and respect people. It is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes.
<HS> Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week. <knowl> The key questions for Muslim youth are: : Does your religion help you respect others and evolve spiritually? People of many faiths have committed violent acts in the name of religion and issued threats over insults. Their decision to cancel was criticised by Jenny Taylor , the founder of Media , a consultancy specialising in religious literacy in world affairs . In this YOU are doing a great disservice to YOUR own religion. YOU forced in 'Hinduism' in this discussion and condemned other religions, not just some practitioners of them, but the ENTIRE religion itself: YOUR child is NO better than anyone else's child to that person !!! <CN> No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions.
<HS> Islam is a violent religion. Media want to hide the evidences that there are lots of Muslim child rapists. They raped children more than a hundred times in a week. <knowl> Third, you mischaracterize their opposition, saying that they oppose all Muslims when only some Muslims are violent. "The Israeli Jewish perspective is that (the dispute with the Palestinians) is a conflict of land and religion which are integrally linked," Mughal says. The more evidence of motive, the more stumped the media elite became. Since it is the religion itself that is violent, any Muslim could become violent at any time by deciding to get serious about his religion. "Many Muslims want religion to play a role in politics," he says. <CN> Such numbers! Are you sure they are true? Can you give a link to the evidence about that?
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> Pakistani officials often complain about the media's portrayal of their country as the epicenter of global terrorism. Over the past year, both Pakistani and U.S. officials have been stressing that relations between their countries have greatly improved. Does Virginia seem like a more likely place than elsewhere to fill up on Pakistani cuisine?The Huffington Post put together a neat map of the country showing which sort of restaurants pop up with more frequency in each state. The last jihadist conglomerate group to create such a frisson among Pakistani militants was Al Qaeda, which remains the predominant foreign group in the country. The move, however, appeared to do little to appease Pakistanis in a country where anti-American sentiment has pervaded society for years and continues to grow. <CN> Punishing the 'Many' for the sins of the 'Few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in?
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> And he thanked medical teams in both countries for the care they have provided. In the conversation, Kelton declined to answer questions about his illness or tenure in Pakistan. A military official in the U.S. Embassy here points to a map of Pakistan. "This (Pakistani) community is petrified of coming out to protest, of having any fingers pointed. Such was the case in the beating death of Saleem Shahzad, a Pakistani investigative journalist, in May. <CN> Except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where I need to be, cook my delicious take away when I haven't got time, teach my children in school. Get the point?
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> Pakistanis are as complex as any other people on the planet. In most cases, India or Pakistan accuses the other of initiating the fighting. The day of the hanging of Bouto, an Pakistani fellow in Qater, was crying. Pakistani intelligence has monitored the phone calls and residences of Save the Children staff. American officials say the main goals of the new assistance will be to shore up the crumbling Pakistani state by building infrastructure like roads and power plants, and to improve the standing of the United States with the Pakistani people. <CN> Rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. The proportion of Pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of White British population.
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> In 2009 , almost 40 years after the events of 1971 , a report published by the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee of Bangladesh accused 1 , 597 people of war crimes , including rape . In Pakistan, Uber must contend with one of the lowest Internet penetration rates in Asia. After the conflict , the Pakistani government decided on a policy of silence regarding the rapes . The safety of both passengers and drivers will also be a major challenge in a country with a high crime rate and an intractable Taliban insurgency. The link includes the full nine-minute discussion with Musharraf on the problem of rape in his country. <CN> Migrants, like those from Pakistan, benefit the UK massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html.
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> It is a terribly exciting time for someone like myself to be British, Pakistani, Muslim and from Birmingham. But she did so from exile in Britain, where she lives still under threat from Pakistan's extremists. The Pakistani Taliban emerged around 2007 as a loose coalition of militant factions in Pakistan's restive border areas.

Pakistani rescue workers take out students from an ambulance who...Pakistani army troops arrive to conduct an operation at a school under attack by Taliban gunmen in Peshawar, Pakistan, Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2014. <CN> All the people from Pakistan that I know are really nice! No need to generalize too much!
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> Pakistanis are pressuring their populist politicians to speak out against the crime, to take sides. Since then, supporters have gathered around the country for small vigils to pray for her recovery. Malala helped Pakistanis realize their own country, their own way of life were threatened by the TTP. The Pakistani Taliban sought to silence the teenage education activist Malala Yousufzai by shooting her in the head. Pakistanis have held rallies for Malala throughout the country, but most have only numbered a few hundred people. <CN> I will not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happens in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. We should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc.
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> The documents could prove embarrassing for other countries allied with Pakistan. No other country ties its hands in deporting foreign criminals as Britain does. They have done it in other countries where they have been very, very hard in, you know, labeling certain organizations in those countries as terrorists. Pakistani journalist had asked Clinton why the fight against terrorism seemed to put Pakistan at the center and why other countries couldn't do more. The ICC is a court of last resort, which only intervenes if a country's justice system is unwilling or incapable of properly reviewing a claim. <CN> Our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. Meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both UK and other countries.
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> Pakistani authorities need to investigate thoroughly and share their full findings with the Pakistani people. The Pakistani military has gone on the offensive in Swat and South Waziristan, at great cost to the Pakistani military and people. "In priorities right now, the Pakistani leadership, civil and military, as well as the Pakistani people, have to take care of the floods. "There is a strong consensus against a military takeover among the Pakistani people. Based on my own visit to the Pakistani consulate in Birmingham on 14 August, it is surprising that Paul Sabapathy could make such sweeping generalisations. <CN> What have 'all' Pakistani people done to deserve deportation? Sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants.
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> Coupled with intense media coverage, the revolt arguably forced Musharraf's resignation months later. These are also the areas where the Pakistani Army is engaged in military action against militant groups, and therefore is more careful about monitoring media coverage. Pakistani officials often complain about the media's portrayal of their country as the epicenter of global terrorism. Our correspondent in Pakistan told us that there was little media coverage of the Kashmir incident in Pakistan. For many Pakistani journalists, the dispute is an ominous sign of the military's intent to influence media coverage of sensitive topics, like the insurgency in Baluchistan Province and relations with India. <CN> Sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage.
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> When are we going to address the military sexual assault epidemic? Ismail Khan reported from Peshawar, and Declan Walsh from Islamabad, Pakistan. Sexual assault is "a problem that's affecting the whole of society. Rape and sexual assault are not isolated incidents in a woman's life. A Pakistani intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr. Shahzad had traveled with three passports, two from Pakistan and one from the United States; he last secured a Pakistani passport in 2000, describing his nationality as Kashmiri. <CN> It is quite a generalisation to say anyone from Pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. Nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault.
<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> But I have found what Ken Clarke said about the proposed shortening of sentences for criminals, including rapists, very offensive.

For British nationals, the government would extend the use of so-called "control orders", which currently allow measures such as limited house arrest for foreign nationals suspected of terrorism. The kidnapping of Pakistani citizens and other foreign nationals, usually for ransom, continues to increase dramatically nationwide, the alert said. The news outlet Ahram Online said the group consists of 29 foreign nationals and 14 Egyptians suspected of receiving "illegal foreign funding — with the alleged aim of destabilizing Egypt's national security. Last year Pakistani media published a photo from Sharbat Gula's computerised national identity card (CNIC), a vital document that she should not have been able to acquire as a foreign national. <CN> We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17.

<HS> One of many Pakistani rapist.we should extradite them from our country. <knowl> Greste, an acclaimed reporter for Al-Jazeera English, was deported last week. The decision to charge them could be a formal part of that process. Ravi's tampering with evidence convictions could also cause him to be deported. Ms. Gula and the two Pakistani officials couldn't be reached to comment. I'm not Haitian, no matter what the government says, Ms. Pierre said. <CN> Deportation is a very serious matter.

The Pakistani-American Muslim community leader, who asked that his name not be used, said the community believes that someone radicalized Farook. The city's Pakistani-American community was already taking steps to counter radicalism, said Khalid Khan of the Pakistani American Association of Greater Houston. <CN> Does Jimmy Saville represent all British Christians? Of course not, punish the individual not the community.
<HS> There are bands of muslim rapists everywhere in telford, rotherham, rochdale, oxford, newcastle etc. It is awful! <knowl> No social worker today will risk being accused of this crime. Matters are made worse by the rise of militant Islam, which has added to the old crime of racism the new crime of 'Islamophobia'. But an awful lot of recent child sexual abuse has been committed by gangs of Muslim men, in Rotherham and countless other towns across the country. It will make the Chilcot Inquiry into the invasion of Iraq resemble a speeding bulletIn Rotherham and Burnley and Oxford and every other town in the country.

There is no possibility - zero, none - of Rotherham ever being run by anyone else. COPS are being investigated over sex abuse allegations in the scandal hit town of Rotherham. <CN> I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.

Nix started Bradford 's first two games of the 2008 - 09 season in place of Joe Colbeck , who was suspended following a red card against Milton Keynes Dons at the end of the previous campaign . More than 10 years before the damning independent inquiry revealed sexual exploitation of 1,400 children in Rotherham a raid was carried out on the orders of senior staff to destroy evidence, it has been claimed. <CN> Do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades?

"It's been open to the rest of the world since 2006, all the cruise lines from Europe have been stopping there. Talk in the Syrian capital, Damascus, among supporters and opponents of the government alike, has turned to plans for getting overseas, especially to Europe. Thousands of migrants and refugees are desperately pushing their way into Europe. <CN> I do not think that can even be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends and family.

Instead, Breivik pleaded not guilty to terror charges, claiming he was in a state of war to protect Europe from being taken over by Muslim immigrants. Generations of Muslim immigrants have come to America to escape repression, poverty, or war in their homelands. Half of all Muslim immigrants display the US flag at home, in the office, or on their car. The Obama administration on Thursday officially scrapped the last vestiges of a U.S. registration system for Muslim immigrants. <CN> Do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists?

Sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden with almost 90 percent of the total number of cases and deaths. China's purchase of Japanese government bonds is barely a drop in the ¥621.1 trillion ocean of outstanding JGBs. Their group of about 20, named A Drop in the Ocean, gathers around her. In that era the fringe of New England, including Boston, was attached to a distant continent comprising Europe and Africa, and separated from the rest of North America by an ocean. <CN> That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases.

The vast majority of Chinas wealthy are self-made multi-millionaires, said Seibold. Three out of five Syrians seeking asylum in Europe are in Germany, Sweden or Serbia. But the vast majority of the gotchas people think they've found are just wrong.

An estimated 90% of Bangladesh's population is Muslim, making Islam far and away the majority religion.

Blue Lives Matter proponents say police are being victimized in a similar manner. <CN> Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow.

REPORTING FROM BEIRUT-- Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of the Lebanese capital Saturday demanding that the government introduce legislation that would criminalize marital rape and all forms of sexual violence. Organizers hoped the march would combat the stigma attached to rape victims and draw international attention to the problem of rape as a war tactic. <CN> Do you know, according to UK's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men.

Both Cruz and Trump called last week for more aggressive monitoring of largely Muslim communities. Muslims have been in Europe in large numbers since the 1950s, and it is only in the last 20 years or so that violent extremism has gained momentum. To improve this further, government officials should continue and expand outreach efforts to the Muslim American community. <CN> Have you checked violent crime statistics? The idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the Muslim community. Religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone.

Britain is becoming the capital of child rapists. <knowl> I can see why the victims of child abuse - of child rape as it is better called - are on edge. Ms. McDonald said she presided over 20 to 30 cases of child sexual abuse each year. The action comes after years of failure by government and tribal law enforcement officials to conduct proper investigations of dozens of cases of child sexual abuse, including rape. This is yet another perfect example of our country's willful ignorance about rape and sexual abuse. States have similar windows, and stratify abuse into categories like forcible rape or rape with the threat of harm. <CN> Child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. In fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. This is a sad truth. We should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape.

There are definitely reasonable factors that exist which explain the difference in salaries between men's and women's sports coaches. Notably, woman's sports coaches' salaries do not exceed those of men's sports coaches at any of the schools listed above. The greatest disparity is found at Kansas, where on average, men's sports coaches earn eight-times that of women's sports coaches. While the text of Title IX itself does not specifically dictate that coaches of men's and women's sports be similarly paid, Title IX's regulations address the compensation of men's and women's sports coaches. <CN> White men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the Church and Hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches.

The administrator of the sites has previously been convicted of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise. "He again committed the crime of producing child exploitation material, this time by writing a number of little stories about children engaging in sexual activity," Chief Justice Alan Blow said. In 2012 alone, the RCMP's National Child Exploitation Co-ordination Centre identified more than 45,000 unique internet addresses where people viewed and shared images of children being sexually abused. <CN> If you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation.

Critics of Islamic religious education in the schools, including many Muslims themselves, say that there is no group in the country that can speak for all Muslims. The group -- a far-right rival of the homegrown English Defense League -- specializes in anti-Muslim street theater, while dressing itself in the garb of a devoutly Christian organization. He repeated the themes of his speeches last year in Egypt and Turkey to reach out to Muslims. Grace, whose leaders include lawyers and psychologists, specializes in advising churches and other Christian organizations on addressing abuse. <CN> #visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion.

It's exciting because we're breaking away from the model of learning things just in Sunday School or church, Lefton told The News. But Protestants have our share of disgraces in the pulpit, too. <CN> #visitmychurch are you going into Churches and asking the same questions of the clergy?
<HS> #visitmymosque.but pretend not to see that lots of white girls are abused by muslims grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale,Tyneside,Teesside etc. <knowl> The force said new officers had been put in charge of all 30 investigations and a senior retired detective had been brought in to review the ongoing child abuse investigations. Most of the 30 investigations relate to the work of the child abuse investigation team that covers north Essex. But what constitutes unnecessary medical care — the heart of the test for medical child abuse — is vague and subjective. They were remanded into the care of the local authority in the meantime. TWO teenage girls snatched a black two-year-old from a Primark store in Newcastle after searching the web for how to rape an African child. <CN> I am more worried about the Pope's recent acknowledgement that Nuns are being abused in the Church right now, as is Child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in Rochdale because no one is looking for them.
<HS> #visitmymosque.but pretend not to see that lots of white girls are abused by muslims grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale,Tyneside,Teesside etc. <knowl> I found Quora's questions and answers to be rather smart and entertaining. Few of these questions can be answered with a simple yes or no. This is because all but a handful of questions are answered with just text. Its Silicon Valley roots are evident in its numerous technology-related questions and answers. There is evidence to support that the young girls in question had been researching rape. <CN> No one's saying do not ask questions. Maybe if you did the answers would surprise you.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> Unfortunately in many parts of the Muslim world men today treat women brutally because of ignorance and prejudice. Benazir Bhutto, a "moderate" Muslim gave her life for her vision of moderate Islam. If Muslims attack Christianity or the Bible or its symbols they are violating their own faith. However, thousands of brave Muslim women are fighting to reassert their role in the Muslim world. We are not all guilty of ignorance, though I think we do perhaps judge American Muslims too much for the crimes of those in the Afg/Pak region. <CN> There are Bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for Christian rapists. The Quran.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> Groups like al-fatiha help gay and lesbian Muslims in the West. Given a green light by self-flagellating Western observers, who will be surprised if groups of Muslims behave in a similar fashion next time someone pulps a Koran or depicts Muhammad as a goat? To be fair, the issue of women's rights has been championed in some democratic societies (eg. Harris Zafar is National Spokesperson of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA -- the oldest Muslim organization in America. the face veil, the second-class status of women in the mosque is a canary in the coalmine. <CN> Can you show me an exact location in Koran where people are encouraged to do this? I do not think so.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> My family adhered to the ninth chapter of the Koran, which says that men and women "are friends and protectors of one another. The hadith simply meant that the prophet regarded marriage as an important aspect of Muslim life. How can you compare the dishonoring of the Holy Koran with the martyrdom of innocent civilians? A large group of people, many of them young children, were gathered around the grisly scene. <CN> This is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life?
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> Gender violence is one of the world's most common human rights abuses. No, it's about human rights — because one of the most searing rights abuses in America is the sexual exploitation of children. The rights group says it has shared the latest evidence with the U.N. Commission of Inquiry investigating human rights abuses in North Korea. The Koran says that women and men are garments to each other. By some accounts, the majority of guards at women's prisons are now men. <CN> All the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> In this sense, it's actually within the power of non-Muslim Americans to help determine the meaning of the Koran. Nowhere in the Koran will you find instructions for a victim of rape to present four witnesses to prove she was raped. Given a green light by self-flagellating Western observers, who will be surprised if groups of Muslims behave in a similar fashion next time someone pulps a Koran or depicts Muhammad as a goat? "ABC News received hundreds of viewer-submitted questions about Muslims and their faith, and posed them to a group of Muslim and non-Muslim scholars of the Koran, who tackled the most common ones. <CN> Would you like to point out where in the Koran it commands rape gangs? Just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> Certain groups of Muslims are adept at nursing and flaunting their grievances, and, as Theodore Dalrymple once put it, there is nothing like grievance to prevent people from examining their own responsibility for their situation. To be fair, the issue of women's rights has been championed in some democratic societies (eg. However, Allah of Islam religiously sanctions muslim men to beat their women if they fear rebellion from them. And speaking of anti-Semitism, the New Testament, like the Koran, has some unflattering things to say about Jews. <CN> Some horrible people are responsible for this. But why assign a religion to this? It has nothing to do with it.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> Muslims are instructed by the Koran to be true to their religion. Now some Sunni militants are urging the killing of Shiites, alleging that they are not true Muslims. Harris Zafar is National Spokesperson of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA -- the oldest Muslim organization in America. Given a green light by self-flagellating Western observers, who will be surprised if groups of Muslims behave in a similar fashion next time someone pulps a Koran or depicts Muhammad as a goat? Rather than address sexual assault as the felony crime of rape, these campuses define it as the honor code violation of nonconsensual sex. <CN> The Quran does command Muslim rape gangs. In fact, sexual violation is regarded by true Muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> However, Allah of Islam religiously sanctions muslim men to beat their women if they fear rebellion from them. Does the wrongs of the christians and the bible makes the evil of the Koran any more acceptable? There are a billion of Muslims around the world who have their own point of views and express them peacefully. The govrnemnt we installed has an army,of modtly Muslim people, that fought alongside our troops against Bin Laden followers. Obviously, despite the evil teachings of Islam, most Muslims, as you said, grow up to be decent average normal people. <CN> We are not accepting this. These people are being rightly punished for their actions. But my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? Do you really think this is the cause of the problem?
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> Many of the leading reformers of Islam were once muslims themselves. Here, the job of settling the Majority-Minority differences lies with Muslims and Koranic scholars -- NOT the rest of the world ! That impression grew out of the fact that women have typically made up the vast majority of volunteers for studies looking at the disorder. A considerable amount of what is known about the AAPI student population has been heavily influenced by stereotypes and distortions, not the complete facts. For Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIS, the holy month of Ramadan -- a time of fasting and prayer for the vast majority of Muslims -- is seen as a particularly auspicious time to launch terrorist attacks. <CN> The vast majority of Muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the Qur'an. Get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people!
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> What a remarkable group of uninteresting facts of either minor or small value in regard to the understanding of this religion. This horrific attack is a complete violation of Islamic law and norms and the perpetrator is no way representative of the Muslim people or the religion of Islam. Muslims in the town were supportive of the community leaders' decision. Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, was the living embodiment of the Koran. Groups like al-fatiha help gay and lesbian Muslims in the West. <CN> The Qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> Prosecutors claim an alleged string of child sex abuses by a former Penn State assistant football coach were covered up. HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell speaks to the attorney of alleged victim #1 in the Penn State sex abuse scandal. To the disillusioned mind, her choice of investigators to sit on the independent panel inquiry into child sex abuse is as suspicious. It only submitted one in 2012 after coming under criticism following the 2010 explosion of child sex abuse cases in Europe and beyond. Second, publicly disclose all of the documents within the Vatican's archives that pertain to reports of child sex abuse, the Vatican's response to it and the hierarchy's role in the abuse. <CN> Child sex abuse happens in all religions. You only have to look at what the Vatican covers up to see that.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> One-third of women said they had been victims of a rape, beating or stalking, or a combination of assaults. That impression grew out of the fact that women have typically made up the vast majority of volunteers for studies looking at the disorder. Fully 20% of undergraduate women - again, one in every five university women - report being victims of rape or attempted rape during their time at college. Instead, the vast majority of rapes are perpetuated by men who know that what they're doing is wrong. These numbers underline the miscarriage of justice that this stockpile of abandoned rape kits represents, a tiny slice of the estimated 400,000 unprocessed rape kits across the country. <CN> The vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. There are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project)
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> Based on news coverage of the issue, those numbers remain constant. Her series of articles about the women in prison, published in the late 1980s in a leading Arabic-language newspaper, attracted a storm of controversy, including a number of death threats. My family adhered to the ninth chapter of the Koran, which says that men and women "are friends and protectors of one another. He also recommended Muslim men to marry fertile women so that he could compete with other prophets with the number of his followers. <CN> The media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving Muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-Muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> What I noticed is the reactions of some friends who are Muslims from the Middle East who found your article hypocritical. Please provide data to support your blanket accusation of Muslim societies. âNowhere in the Koran does it tell you kill women like this. The Koran says that women and men are garments to each other. <CN> Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2GHjGn7.
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> In one village, I asked a large group of men about rape. Harris Zafar is National Spokesperson of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA -- the oldest Muslim organization in America. This meant that hundreds of thousands of victims, mostly women, were never taken seriously or given an opportunity for justice — and their rapists were free to rape again. The terror group's human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be 'kafir', non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. "When does it become acceptable amongst a group of peers to rape a girl and laugh about it? <CN> Many rapes are also committed by non-Muslim perpetrators. Are you picking out Muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate?
<HS> There are groups of Muslims, instructed by Koran, that rape our women, and we allow this to happen. Why? <knowl> At night, vivid memories of sexual abuse haunt Smita Sharma's dreams. For many reasons, experts say, men face different feelings of shame and guilt than women experience when reporting childhood sexual abuse. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, around 80,000 women and men a year are sexually abused in American correctional facilities. "Laws in India prohibit the identification of sexual abuse victims for privacy purposes. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, passed in 2005, enables women to access civil remedies for domestic violence including sexual abuse. <CN> Actually, the Qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. Muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by Muslim teachings, and are denounced by true Muslims.
<HS> Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values! <knowl> Our children are minors who have not reached the age of consent, Omalu wrote. The standardisation of age of consent for sexual acts will bring Queensland into line with other jurisdictions. He went on: On the age of consent, I have always supported equalisation of the age of consent. What is missing from this debate so far is anyone making powerful arguments in favour of raising the digital age of consent. I do not support reducing the age of consent or legalising incest. <CN> Let's remind ourselves that in the US, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of Delaware where it was 7. We live in more enlightened times.
<HS> Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values! <knowl> Christian conservatives and libertarians agreed that misconceived government programs were harming traditional values. Arguing for less government, traditional values and a tough response to Moscow worked. The result is that Islamic radicalisation gradually took hold in Syria, bringing fertile ground for Isis. The era of big government is far from over, and liberals and libertarians gain nothing from fighting over its inevitable growth. But precisely because government is on a trajectory of unsustainable expansion, liberals and libertarians have a common interest in reinventing it. <CN> The value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance.
<HS> Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values! <knowl> This creed is the heart of limited government and "traditional values." Christian conservatives and libertarians agreed that misconceived government programs were harming traditional values. Arguing for less government, traditional values and a tough response to Moscow worked. The propensity to want the government to promote traditional values — as opposed to not favor any particular set of values — rose from 48% in 2008 to 53% in 2009. And it is traditionally personified by the image of a woman. <CN> Sexualization of children is a modern value? Do you actually know what is meant by values?
<HS> Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values! <knowl> Liberal Leader Wade MacLauchlan has now set the date for a balanced budget under a Liberal government for April 2016. Nonetheless, it should be made clear to the Polish government that its retreat from the fundamental values of liberal democracy is reprehensible and foolish. Therefore, per Fukuyama, the end point of history had been reached with the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government. Senator Leyonhjelm said resolving the problem was a serious issue for tourism. But he fears a vicious circle of public discontent and weak governments. <CN> I agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or Governments.
<HS> Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values! <knowl> Add in the dangers of wider radicalisation, and this matters to Moscow too. The result is that Islamic radicalisation gradually took hold in Syria, bringing fertile ground for Isis. Within Government - among ministers, Coalition partners, officials and agencies - there is an endless battle on this matter. A pending government review into extremism in British prisons, however, may overhaul the approach to terrorist prisoners. Confronted with the frightening prospect of a minority population alienated from the Republic and susceptible to the lures of an anti-state Islamism, it is no surprise that French public opinion has latched on to the issue of prison radicalisation. <CN> These matters are not being ignored. Have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted?
<HS> Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values! <knowl> For just as Republicans want government to restore traditional values, so Democrats want government to bring back the economic order that existed before globalization. This creed is the heart of limited government and "traditional values." As Lindsey himself says, the ambition of realistic libertarians is not to shrink government but to contain it: to cut senseless spending such as the farm program and oil subsidies to make room for the inevitable expansion in areas such as health. Speaking about gay people during a Crimean government session on Tuesday, the region's de facto leader Sergei Aksyonov said we in Crimea do not need such people. The propensity to want the government to promote traditional values — as opposed to not favor any particular set of values — rose from 48% in 2008 to 53% in 2009. <CN> I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people.
<HS> Our government has a liberal approach that pretends not to see violence against minors, Islamic radicalisation and so on. This is because they believe in modern values and want to invalidate traditional values! <knowl> For months, I tried to approach some of the arms of the government, wanting to understand what they viewed as legitimate and illegitimate NGO activity. Traditionally, NGOs and philanthropic entities focus on how 'affordable' an employee is. Israel's liberal NGOs get funding from foreign governments, including the United States. Even the Americans have weighed in against this NGO bill, which is unusual. The attacks against NGOs have been fierce, said Cesar Ricaurte, the director of Fundamedios. <CN> Why would you say that? Actually there are many government organisations and NGOs that help and control the rape crimes.
<HS> Britain is not on our side. It does not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law? <knowl> Its first three words - We The People - affirm that the government of theUnited States exists to serve its citizens. echoes?The majority of US citizens - especially Hispanics, younger Americans and Democrats - support a path to either citizenship or permanent residency for undocumented immigrants. "Many of these families were having one child after another just to earn a paycheck from the U.S. government and they didn't care about their children's education," says Gaines, the controversial founder of American Citizens United, a grass-roots organization known for its extreme views on immigration enforcement. Any changes to security measures are a matter for the UK government. Gordon Brown today decided to allow the attorney general, Lady Scotland, to remain in government after she was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant. <CN> Our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. Does it mean that the government is submitting to them? To me it means being humane! You should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not.
<HS> Britain is not on our side. It does not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law? <knowl> To many in the government, the answer is for Muslim communities to look within. Separate figures showed the number of foreign-born people in Britain has topped eight million for the first time. Recognizing the critical role of informed citizens in correcting the excesses of government, the Council of Europe called for new laws to protect whistle-blowers. Today, Prevent is a dirty word among many Muslims, a shorthand for a government more interested in surveillance than in protecting vulnerable young people from radicalization. New figures from Facebook show that the German government makes more requests for user data, relative to the size of its Facebook userbase, than any other. <CN> Could point to me a specific law for Muslim criminals? I cannot find one. It is not true that they are judged differently. In fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely.
<HS> Britain is not on our side. It does not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law? <knowl> Its first three words - We The People - affirm that the government of theUnited States exists to serve its citizens. That burden has been extended despite the Iranian government's hatred for these BBC reporters. A 2006 poll found that 40 percent of Muslims would welcome Shariah law in Britain. Many polls have shown that Muslims identify with Britain to a greater degree than the population at large. While anti-Muslim hatred is certainly present, there is by no means a climate of relentless hostility toward Muslims. <CN> Where is your evidence for this? This is just hatred.
<HS> Britain is not on our side. It does not protect our citizens. It cannot protect our people from Muslim rapists. Do we still continue supporting this government and the law? <knowl> It says it would pay for this change by savings from Britain's contributions to the EU budget. Its first three words - We The People - affirm that the government of theUnited States exists to serve its citizens. Many citizens are angry about these problems over the causes of the financial crisis, and this small contribution of very tiny rates could help rebuild confidence in the financial sector, Mr. Semeta said. However, in attempting to overrule British law on prisoner voting rights, Strasbourg judges have exceeded the limits of their proper authority. Britain has no formal equivalent of America's constitutional guarantee against unreasonable search, although that concept is rooted in English common law. <CN> Have faith in British Law. Indeed, the Muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. Criminals will not get special treatment. Everyone can change the situation even if it is a small contribution. For example, teach children to arm themselves and report suspicious events.
<HS> Muslims can rape white girls without consequences, but if a white man did this to a muslim girl, he would be in jail. <knowl> In America, it's an extremely rare occurrence for an all-white jury to convict a white man, particularly a white police officer, of crimes against black women. To me, rape was a screaming vindictive white woman and a framed black man. Can a man rape a man?Rape is strictly a crime of men against women. The F.B.I. currently classifies nearly all hate violence against American Sikhs as instances of anti-Islamic or anti-Muslim hate crimes. The excuses to call a white, male mass-killer anything but a terrorist are familiar - they're part of a refrain repeated over and over again when a horrific crime intended to terrify a group of people is committed by a white man. <CN> This isn't. This is a false dichotomy. All crime and hatred is wrong.
<HS> Muslims can rape white girls without consequences, but if a white man did this to a muslim girl, he would be in jail. <knowl> Girls are told to keep their relationship with the older man secret. Most recently, a 16-year-old French Muslim girl wasfor wearing a hijab. [Kardashian]."Rose has become increasingly vocal about sexism and double standards toward women in the media. According to French media reports, a 15-year-old French Muslim girl was banned from her class twice for wearing a skirt that was too long, and therefore supposedly a conspicuous display of religion. Laws should be about defining criminal acts and law enforcement should be about bringing criminals to justice. <CN> Who can say that Muslims are privileged? They are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. I do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, Muslim criminals are also judged by their own community.
<HS> Muslims can rape white girls without consequences, but if a white man did this to a muslim girl, he would be in jail. <knowl> "So where is the movie "For White Girls," bashing white men? Girls are told to keep their relationship with the older man secret. And he, as a rich, powerful, white man in the United States, doesn't understand that he is among the most privileged people in the world. Stories of white men kidnapping and abusing white girls are in the news. Most recently, a 16-year-old French Muslim girl wasfor wearing a hijab. <CN> Why do you think that muslim criminals will receive different treatment or even privileges?
<HS> Muslims can rape white girls without consequences, but if a white man did this to a muslim girl, he would be in jail. <knowl> Most recently, a 16-year-old French Muslim girl wasfor wearing a hijab. wasn't gonna rape anyone today, but then I heard that new Thugger tape. [Kardashian]."Rose has become increasingly vocal about sexism and double standards toward women in the media. Scores of countries are routinely violating international agreements on the treatment of prisoners without facing any consequences. No, this isn't another story of double-standards and star athletes getting away with special treatment. <CN> No one is allowed to rape anyone. There are no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it.
<HS> People are afraid of Muslims rape gangs and the spread of extremism, even if you pretend not to see it. <knowl> The rise of the Islamic State in the Middle East and the spread of extremism among disaffected Muslim youths around the world have led even some liberal people to condemn Islam itself as violent and intolerant. He emphasized that of course I would protect (Muslims), you know, the good ones, not the extremists. "Be glad of the good news: America is mired in the swamps of the Tigris and Euphrates. You have indeed slaughtered the enemy and have pleased the hearts of all Muslims, particularly the Palestinian people. But insert pretty much any other group of people instead of "Muslims", and the statement would be true. <CN> I noticed what you said and the concerns it caused. Actually, Muslims are kind and sincere. However, people usually can access only negative events and issues about Islam and do not consider good news meaningful. We do not want only fear to exist in the society. Hence, we should help people know about Islam and Muslims.
<HS> People are afraid of Muslims rape gangs and the spread of extremism, even if you pretend not to see it. <knowl> He said Afghanistan is "uniquely positioned" to block the spread of extremism. More than 80 percent of US Muslims expressed satisfaction with life in America, and 63 percent said they felt no conflict between being a devout Muslim and living in a modern society. Working with Arab partners, we are also amplifying the moderate voices of Islam through institutions like the Muslim Council of Elders and the Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies. A joint UAE-US initiative, the Sawab Center is confronting the spread of extremism in social media and online. The rise of the Islamic State in the Middle East and the spread of extremism among disaffected Muslim youths around the world have led even some liberal people to condemn Islam itself as violent and intolerant. <CN> Rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to Muslims only? This is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse Muslims.
<HS> People are afraid of Muslims rape gangs and the spread of extremism, even if you pretend not to see it. <knowl> So we need a broad understanding of it and an understanding of how it is affected by hate speech, not a technical definition. No topic is more frequently debated with less resolution than hate speech. It is unanswerable because hate speech is a category without a stable content. In the end, none of the alternative ways of dealing with hate speech is entirely satisfying. This is not to deny the urgency for new and more effective measures to address hateful speech. <CN> As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors.
<HS> People are afraid of Muslims rape gangs and the spread of extremism, even if you pretend not to see it. <knowl> He said Afghanistan is "uniquely positioned" to block the spread of extremism. Racism is a specific, chosen ideology of hatred and domination. ... The rise of the Islamic State in the Middle East and the spread of extremism among disaffected Muslim youths around the world have led even some liberal people to condemn Islam itself as violent and intolerant. Besides, most of that kind of evidence was destroyed by the river. While he warned of what he described as a "darker cloud" of extremism looming over the region, Ghani also voiced hope about Afghanistan's future. <CN> People's concerns must be based on evidence and not hatred.
<HS> I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism. <knowl> The Catholic organization Knights of Columbus last week released a 280-page research document highlighting Christians as victims of ISIS genocide. We are seeing the mainstreaming of hate rhetoric targeting Muslims, Mr. Hooper added. Indeed, a substantial number of Isis sympathizers are converts to Islam - hardly lifelong devotees. In Boston, one assistant U.S. attorney works to gain the trust of Muslim. And I'm OK with that, because I'm talking territory instead of Muslim. <CN> The often ignored fact is that Muslims are some of the largest victims of ISIS and within the ISIS-controlled community itself.
<HS> I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism. <knowl> He said there was such hatred among Muslims towards Americans that it was necessary to stop them coming to the US until the problem was better understood. He said there was such hatred among Muslims around the world towards Americans that it was necessary to rebuff them en masse, until the problem was better understood. Since 9/11, Paris and San Bernardino attacks, he continued, You've seen too often people conflating the horrific acts of terrorism with the beliefs of an entire faith. Muslim groups and countries widely condemned the terror attacks in Paris, and Muslims and supporters around the world took to social media to defend Islam as a nonviolent faith. A war on Islam would make a war on terrorism impossible. <CN> Why would it? Why such hatred towards an entire faith?
<HS> I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism. <knowl> Their biggest show of terror on the innocent people of Kashmir is the longest and biggest example of "State Terrorism" by any other country. There are obvious advantages - for terrorism as for any other illegal or clandestine activity. "This event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality. The variation among criminal faces is significantly greater than that of the non-criminal faces. Terrorism is a social activity, and its mechanics resemble any other social activity, despite its terrible, tragic consequences. <CN> Crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. Christian criminals are also not held by religious events. It is just not correct to align religion and criminality.
<HS> I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism. <knowl> It is likely a case of homegrown terrorism, perhaps inspired by ISIS, similar to what we saw a month ago in Orlando. adding that they are treating this as an incident of workplace violence. French officials wasted no time labeling Friday's attack an act of terrorism. All of these attacks have moved terrorism to the forefront of political debate. The leader of Isis, abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is a generation younger than Zawahiri. <CN> Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions.
<HS> I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism. <knowl> But none of the terror attacks have been committed by Syrian immigrants. So it goes, according to new research by a terrorism prosecutions expert in Portland, Ore., when it comes to public perception of what constitutes terrorism. The trial follows the passage of new terrorism laws in Hungary this summer. The short answer is that there are a lot of kinds of terrorism.

Saudi Arabia is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. A poster of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is held at a protest against Isis insurgency. <CN> There are many examples of Muslims protesting against ISIS. Seriously, do a google search.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia says there is no evidence that Usama bin Laden's wives and family members deported to the kingdom are involved in terrorism.

Adherents of political Islam regularly threaten me, an apostate from their faith. One of the reasons why the vast majority of British Muslims don't get diverted down a path of radicalisation is that they really know their faith.

Access to more lethal weaponry and increasing use of tactics like suicide bombings capable of killing scores of bystanders. <CN> So when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer.

Follow Acts of Faith on Twitter or sign up for our newsletter. Yet we have not always approached the history of nazism in this way. Though their influence might still be minimal, a few journalists are speaking out.

"Terrorism and extremism of any kind is never acceptable and we pride ourselves on opposing these," the statement said. And while some critics are quick to point to such murders as examples of alleged Islamic terrorism, few have the education or compassion to see the peaceful and patient response as examples of Islamic teaching. And millions of Muslims in Pakistan and worldwide exist who reject terrorism, extremism, intolerance and oppression deserve a platform too.

<HS> Nazism is like terrorism. At the beginning only a few Germans supported it and with Muslims it is the same. <knowl> In fact, almost every claim the fact checkers have parsed from Trump has been of the four-Pinocchio variety. Rather than quibbling over facts — endlessly, since we lack a shared standard for determining factuality — perhaps more focus should be placed on understanding exactly why conservatives believe the facts they do choose to believe. Even pebbles cause ripples, and words have a way of spreading. Critics, from the Nation magazine to congressional Democrats, denounced Facts Forum for spreading half-truths, distortions, generalizations and exaggerations, while forum participants saw themselves as fighting apathy, and shaping public opinion in their own image. Trump has demonstrated an openness in the past to spreading Internet rumors. <CN> Actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of Muslims who might be extremists. So stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion.
<HS> The mental problem that terrorists have in common is Islam! Muslims are crazy! <knowl> I think that islamic extremists find it empowering to bully people. It has always seemed absurd that people question other people's faith. Part of the problem in getting answers is that Islam has no hierarchy. Implying that these terrorists speak for Islam aids their propaganda, Mr. Obama said. It's people you that make it difficult for people to understand people like us. <CN> I agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other Muslim people!

"The fastest growing group of all is those with no religion," Roozen said. "The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam," he said. <CN> I do not see a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat.
<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> How many palestinian homes did israelis - jewish terrorists - demolish?

<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> Not all terrorist attacks in India have been carried out by Muslims. But Pakistan might well grant the terrorists a Muslim burial, Indians would become furious, and foreign relations between the countries would further deteriorate. Which makes a lot of sense in a country that is primarily Lutheran. Just 3% of those agencies viewed the threat from Muslim extremists as severe. For instance, 171 of the 188 terrorism cases studied involved no actual attacks. <CN> So do all those Western bombings and invasions of Muslim countries not count as terrorism?
<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> 3. Did it involve an organized group (not a lone wolf)? There remains a real threat, especially from lone wolf attacks, as the cachet of the Islamic State inspires Muslims around the world. The war on terrorism — especially on lone-wolf terrorism — requires new countermeasures. Not to say that non-Muslim whites never get tagged as terrorists. The focus should be on high-risk communities, both Muslim and non-Muslim. <CN> Only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. Instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'.
<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> After the 7/7 terrorist murders, the Home Office commissioned reports from Muslim working parties.

<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> Not all terrorist attacks in India have been carried out by Muslims.

Not all terrorist attacks in India have been carried out by Muslims. Terrorism is just terrorism, and it should not be linked with anything else. For instance, 171 of the 188 terrorism cases studied involved no actual attacks. Terrorism is as abhorrent to most Muslims as it is for most of us. <CN> This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.
<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> Placards read, bottom left, "Terrorism a threat to humanity", bottom right, "Terrorism should end".

<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> The venom on the airwaves, equating Muslims with terrorists, should embarrass us more than you. Americans were among the victims of both attacks as the terrorists do not differentiate between us and our close allies. The de Blasio administration is trying to avoid the ideological foundation of the war radical Islamic terrorists are waging against us. Homeland Security and F.B.I. put us under surveillance, asking people, 'Where are the terrorists?' one interviewee, a Salafi who professed nonviolence, told us. Hillary Clinton refused to declare war on ISIS Sunday, defending her position that followers of the terrorist organization should not be called radical Islamic terrorists. <CN> What about recent school and mall shootings all over the US?

Page is not, of course, the only right-wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends. Page is not, of course, the only right wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends. <CN> Studies in the US show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not Muslims.

<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> Only the muslim terrorist is capable of mass murder of civilian lives. The focus should be on high-risk communities, both Muslim and non-Muslim. Europe's bigger problem is the divide between its Muslim and non-Muslim communities. Then there's the continuing danger from home-grown terrorists, be they self-activated jihadists like Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan or non-Muslim anti-government fanatics. Is there any American Muslim standing up and speaking against the hate for non-Muslims in the Koran? <CN> How about all those non-Muslim school shooters? Is mass murder not terrorism if a non-Muslim does it?
<HS> It is true that there are some Muslims that aren't terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims. <knowl> Not to say that non-Muslim whites never get tagged as terrorists. Not all terrorist attacks in India have been carried out by Muslims. Well -- it it shouldn't be offensive to Muslims and Muslims and aren't terrorists.

He is not a suspect, but a model; not a terrorist, but a person with dignity; not a foreigner, but an American. It has been viewed as a test of the government's desire to bring prosecutions in instances in which terrorist plots are in the early stages. Mohammad said he told authorities that his son was a terrorist.

Terrorist attacks carry the risk of a copycat effect, Mr. Roy said. It was just six weeks after the November Mumbai terrorist attacks and Indian Muslims were being viewed with suspicion across the country. Ted Cruz said in the wake of Tuesday's terrorist attacks in Brussels that law enforcement should closely guard Muslim neighborhoods, prompting swift criticism. To many Muslims, it seemed that the United States was going to battle against them. <CN> Many Muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the US and 7/7 in the UK.
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> adds, "Next thing there's a terrorist attack and the public erupts in anti-Muslim rage. It was the first terrorist attack in Kuwait in more than two decades. The French state, in turn, like other states, must recommit itself to combating prejudice against Muslims. Not only did the presumptive nominee politicize the terrorist attack in Orlando, but in targeting Muslim Americans, he also used language without modern precedent in mainstream American politics. The survey itself was taken before the attacks, so it likely doesn't capture the full spectrum of fear and mistrust among U.S. demographic groups that exists toward Muslims today. <CN> No, Muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the Middle-East.
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> At what point does a devout Muslim preacher become a radicalizer? At no point did his handler say he was going too far. Executive Decision, featuring a plane hijack by Palestinian terrorists, also shows terrorists reciting prayers before and after murdering innocent passengers, "almost defining terrorism as an Islamic ritual", it adds. There is no profile of someone who becomes a terrorist or checklist of indicators. The terrorists there didn't say they carried out their attack for religious reasons. <CN> Every person is a potential terrorist. What is your point?
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> They were the seething terrorists, without any sort of humanizing attributes. Like most human beings, the majority of Muslims are quite boring. Hollywood still has a long way to go to humanize Muslims, Al-Marayati acknowledged. But we have seen a great many terrorist acts committed by Muslims since 9/11. She and her husband said they lament the terrorist acts that took Christian, Muslim and Jewish lives. <CN> And views like that, that lumps all Muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer.
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> It is an unfortunate and long-standing double standard that a life lost in a terrorist attack in western hemisphere counts more. Terrorism is as abhorrent to most Muslims as it is for most of us. First, it only shows the frequency of terrorist attacks and attempted attacks, not severity. After news broke about the Paris slaughter, I received an e-mail from the Muslim Times condemning the attack and stressing Islam's peaceful nature. "Britain has suffered terrorist attacks before, terrorist attacks from the IRA, terrorist attacks from Islamic extremists," Cameron said Wednesday. <CN> Every Muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about Muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.)
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> Not to say that non-Muslim whites never get tagged as terrorists. In India, there was sober reflection in some quarters about prejudices against Muslims. Like many Indians, Aseemanand was furious with terrorist attacks in the country carried out by Muslims. The police could not have monitored New Jersey for Muslim terrorist activities without monitoring the Muslim community itself. You would search in vain, however, for other non-Muslim perpetrators of mass violence in this country who have been similarly branded. <CN> I think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-Muslims as well?
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> The terrorists of the Solo plot, for example, apparently couldn't figure out the right chemicals to make explosives. It is this issue, not religious freedom and surely not bigotry against Muslims, that led us to our statement. "Here at this mosque, and across our country and around the world, Muslim leaders are roundly and repeatedly and consistently condemning terrorism," he said. Indeed, we have publicly taken on those who criticized the mosque in ways that reflected anti-Muslim bigotry or used the controversy for that purpose. It couldn't have come at a better time," said Farhana Khera, the executive director of Muslim Advocates, who cited an uptick in vandalism at mosques, and violence against Muslims entering and exiting places of worship, as indications the time was right for a presidential visit. <CN> Every Islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against Muslims. Terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes.
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> Executive Decision, featuring a plane hijack by Palestinian terrorists, also shows terrorists reciting prayers before and after murdering innocent passengers, "almost defining terrorism as an Islamic ritual", it adds. So when a white person holds objectionable views — racism, for example — we rightly condemn them. Britain's domestic intelligence service, MI5, has said that as many as 2,000 Muslims in Britain are involved in terrorist cells, and that it tracks dozens of potential terrorist plots at any one time. My initial instinct is to match the level of aggression from the person who is confronting me. Three U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on Tuesday joined a growing campaign to expand protections for Americans who tip off law enforcement to potential terrorist threats from discrimination lawsuits if they identify the wrong person. <CN> How can you say a person is a potential terrorist?
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> The US government has begun asking select foreign travelers to disclose their social media activities as part of an expanded effort to spot potential terrorist threats. "The provisional results of the investigation indicate that it would be a potential terrorist attack," the statement said. Earlier today, the RCMP received credible information regarding a potential terrorist threat and took action to ensure public safety. "She said local and state law enforcement agencies must be given better, more timely intelligence on potential terrorist threats. <CN> You could say that about any person, Muslim or not. According to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than Muslims. Does that make you a potential terrorist?
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> The bigger problem, though, may be letting terrorist suspects into Britain in the first place. At least nine countries are trying to win the extradition of terrorist suspects living in Britain, according to a report by the French National Assembly. How are Muslim countries to launch jihad; attack Israel, US and Britain. Britain is perceived as an ineffectual junior partner to a discredited US. Perino noted that Pakistan, too, has been the victim of horrific terrorist attacks. <CN> But not the ones that fought and died for Britain in both wars and all wars after.
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> When you assign (individuals' actions) to the entire community, you assign blame to the whole group. "When you assign their violent action to the entire community, you assign collective blame to a whole group," Ellison said. Each of these individuals chose to fight for a community not their own. Thank you.- October 21, 2010 12:48 PMNo, smart terrorists don't dress like stereotypes. Somalis are integrating into American culture; Homeland Security officials should appreciate their success without impugning the entire community. <CN> Why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few?
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> I would limit specific terrorist countries, and we know who those terrorist countries are. What kind of terrorist does that?At Outside the Beltway, James Joyner argues that whether Hasan is a 'terrorist' depends entirely on his motivation. Will our country be able, then, to integrate the Afghan Taliban and members of ISIS, who enforce their religious beliefs with beheadings and terrorist attacks? We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. <CN> Any individual may become a terrorist. Religious beliefs do not play part in this.
<HS> We should not trust any Muslim, they all could become a terrorist. <knowl> This film addresses the very point they are raising and uses comedy to dispel misconceptions about Muslims. Naik, a trained doctor, founded the Peace TV channel, which supposedly reaches an audience of 100 million English-speaking Muslims. It helps a terrorist organisation that's on a murderous rampage killing Muslim and non-Muslim people in their way. Bill Maher made a similar point when he claimed that hundreds of millions of Muslims applaud an attack like this. But he said he was rarely considered for parts playing doctors, lawyers ... or anything, really, but menacing Muslims during the early days of his career. <CN> Every Muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. What is your point?
<HS> Minister, do not hide! We must fight Islam that causes terror and crisis! <knowl> "Oriental societies" were represented as simply the negative counterpart of Western societies. This is not the work of a dark ideology but of jihadi terror. The refugee crisis presents yet another test for the idea of an integrated Europe. The frequency of terror attacks is not even unusual in Europe's recent history. "We will never give in to terror -- or terrorism -- in any of its forms. <CN> Can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? I do not see it in our society.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> For years, politicians of all stripes hid or returned financial contributions from homosexuals for fear of being tainted. As homosexuality becomes more and more of a thread in the fabric of American life, gays, gay rights and gay life styles have become a chief political target of the right. In a free, democratic society, the right of people to express themselves should always and absolutely trump the so-called right of sensitive people never to hear or see something they don't like. "As Clinton speaks, shortly after the Republican National Convention, he is already being attacked by Republicans for his strong support of gay rights. Instead of excluding homosexuals from protected status, Question 1 asks whether civil-rights safeguards should be conferred solely on the basis of certain characteristics. <CN> Violating of rights for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native Western people are also held accountable for it. Oppressing rights is not the feature of Islam but of our society in general.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> Christianity teaches love, mercy, and forgiveness for those who do bad things, true enough. "Although the concept of forgiveness is fabulous it is not the reason to become a Christian. Do you want public broadcast of Islamic faith, for Sunnis to seek to convert Buddhists, or Christians? What does it look like to remain faithful to God while loving neighbors who passionately disagree with Christian convictions? In other words, it does not make sense that Christian evangelicals would be a party to murdering the gays. <CN> I think you'd be surprised at the number of similarities Islam shares with Christianity. It teaches love and forgiveness, not oppression.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> Nothing Francis said in this or other interviews indicate any change in church teaching. Many will just walk away, others will just wait out the church's crisis. First, it said it would preserve its policy of excluding homosexuals, which enraged liberals. "Snyder said Phelps and other Westboro church members caused him depression and worsened his diabetes. The truth is that once homosexuality is cleansed from the Roman Catholic Church, the problem of clerical sex crime will be solved. <CN> Sounds more like the Catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #InquiryCSA.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> Shine calculates, would cost $300 a day, a figure obviously out of reach for the vast majority of Americans. The writer is a member of the Muslim Writers Guild of America. Gay priests and others argue that there is no direct link between homosexuality and pedophilia, noting that the majority of offenders are hetereosexuals. Though the PACS was originally intended as an alternative to marriage for homosexuals, the vast majority of the unions are now between a man and woman. Some are likely far smarter and more admirable than the vast majority of their fellow citizens. <CN> The opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of Muslim women in Britain have choice.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> "If a person chooses counseling, then it should be made available. The "Free World," it appears, may be losing faith in free speech. Challenging the beliefs of other faiths can be part of that exercise. It empowers small groups of people to clamour for, and sometimes win, the removal from public life of what they consider to be shocking or outrageous ideas. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill is still being discussed and may become law this year. <CN> How exactly is the government submitting to this? I do not see Muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems Muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> In other words, while I and almost half of America do consider Mormons to be Christians, the rest do not. Their liberal and moderate counterparts demonstrate a truer example of Christian ministry. In other words it has no standing outside the realm of rumor. Challenging the beliefs of other faiths can be part of that exercise. These "liberal" Christians find much in common with Obama's "many roads to God". <CN> We could easily substitute the word 'Christians' for the word 'Muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundamentalism' as any particular faith.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> Challenging the beliefs of other faiths can be part of that exercise. I don't mean culture that happens to be produced by homosexuals, which includes some of the greatest art in history. I'm sure there are plenty of other venues willing to host movie premieres, record launch parties and Lindsay Lohan's entourage. But even if homosexuality is no longer a crime in Hong Kong, a stigma remains, as do discriminatory statutes with double standards. Chomsky hits back at Erdoğan, accusing him of double standards on terrorismOn Friday Turkish security forces briefly detained 27 academics accused of terrorist propaganda. <CN> If we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to LGBT and Women's rights, are we not also guilty of double standards?
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> The Anti-Homosexuality Bill is still being discussed and may become law this year. This Latter Day feeding frenzy stands in stark contrast to the media hands off approach to the Jeremiah Wright story four years ago. Mr. McDonnell has sought to corner Mr. Deeds by focusing on debates in Washington over energy policy, labor union membership and other contentious federal issues. In 2012, for example, its subsidiary, Image Media Abu Dhabi, financed a new movie starring Matt Damon called "Promised Land," about the evils of hydraulic fracking. Another great British tradition is respect for other cultures and religions; for centuries we have been doing this far better than many countries in the world. <CN> [link to Raheem Stirling article or other biased media example] Media bias against the Muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> While homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey, unlike many other Muslim countries, homophobia remains widespread. In some parts of the Muslim world, stoning is a form of punishment reserved for adulterers. Under the Moudawana, the progressive family code reformed in 2004, Moroccan women have been endowed with rights not present--or even conceivable--in other parts of the Muslim world. There is widespread anti-homosexual sentiment in the Muslim world because of the belief that Sharia requires the execution of gays. In 2006, Iran achieved approval ratings of around 75% in the Arab and Muslim world, and scored an impressive 85% among the Saudi public. <CN> Is there any evidence of muslim immigrants oppressing anyone? I would like to see the official statistics for it, in particular for our country (not muslim world in general).
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> Every time another child is encouraged to become a homosexual another life is exposed to a high prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Drugs of the illegal or abused kind are BAD, a homosexual life is NOT...its fabulous!tipo: it is interesting that you and others accuse me of hating and spreading hate. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. HIV is prevalent in homosexual males, but it is also prevalent in sexually uneducated youth and minorities. As soon as other straight people stop having premarital and extramarital sex, they can say homosexuality is wrong. <CN> Unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. It is no more prevalent in Muslim communities.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> Interestingly, the versions we eat are nearly all inspired by other cultures. Intolerant and illiberal doctrines related to martyrdom, blasphemy, honor and apostasy reliably lead to oppression and violence against women, homosexuals, freethinkers, liberals and even other Muslims. We don't want to offend other cultures, they quoted her as explaining. Travelers home for the holidays don't have to stop exploring other cultures. The other question is whether these Muslim-oriented collections will reach Western stores. <CN> How exactly are Muslims oppressing other cultures? Do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all Muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture?
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> First, it said it would preserve its policy of excluding homosexuals, which enraged liberals.

<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> The law in California and other states made it illegal for homosexuals to assemble in public. But obviously others in the decision - making process were truly upset with homosexuality . The group Mr. Hay founded — one that exists in remnants today — was the Mattachine Society. "Homosexuals are protected against assault like any other Americans," Mrs. Cosby said in an interview. For those who accuse Christians of being intolerant or trying to push their values on others, ALL people in any society try to draw lines which they want others to abide by. <CN> Actually women and homosexuals have not receive the right treatment in many places for a very long time, not just in Muslim culture. Plus, the society has not changed too much. The most important thing is how we can make the society and the world a better place, not just excluding others.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> Though "physical violence" could encompass sexual violence, activists say the absence of the word is worrying — and telling.

At least six others reportedly were stoned to death, including one man sentenced for homosexuality who had survived being pushed off a building in March. The impetus for my writing is concern regarding increased hatred and disrespect toward women, other cultures and religions - as if Christians in the United States had a flawless history. Challenging the beliefs of other faiths can be part of that exercise. <CN> Surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> We must support Muslim and other minority communities in the U.S. and around the world.

Maajid Nawaz, the Liberal Democrat PPCYesterday, two very striking things happened on the freedom-of-speech front. Participants had seen victory after victory for their cause, and many others had jumped on the proverbial bandwagon, much as a winning sports team suddenly gathers a lot of new fans. <CN> Last I checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. Much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on Muslims and other minority communities to try to paint a false image. Don't be fooled by their fake news.

Lewis thinks that's because Muslim-focused fashions can serve other cultures as well, as part of an emerging modesty movement. After all, if the rejection of radical Islam constitutes an "anti-Muslim" viewpoint, then, by extension, all Muslims must be radical. <CN> I can feel you. However, the majority of Muslims are not against women or other cultures. They are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. Keeping Muslims away is not helpful either. Instead, we could think of ways to increase the disparity.
<HS> These liberal standards! Muslims are intolerant with other cultures, women and homosexuals, but our society protects them with this liberalist policy. <knowl> No other religion can exist because their God is the one true god. Other Western countries, including Canada and Britain, are also cracking down on religious critics. "Muslims are only 6 million out of 300 million in this country," one reminds me. Any time you hear a Christian condemning Muslims for practicing their faith, that person is a fanatic. While race remained the highest motivator, religion appeared to account for one-quarter of the police-reported hate crimes. <CN> Why do you say that they are never taken responsibility? Crimes are punished regardless of religion in our country. If a Muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished.
<HS> Women of our culture that decide to become Islamic are so selfish. They are so happy and proud to join this religion while living in the west but I would like to see them in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Sudan. <knowl> Saudi Arabia's radical form of Islam mandates the death penalty for same-sex relations.

Days later, Iran accused Saudi Arabia of intentionally striking its embassy in Yemen. Saudi Arabia remains an ally of the West in the many chess games playing out in the Middle East. What reminder can the First Lady of the United States of America, a strong ally of Saudi Arabia, who is fully aware of the oppressive nature of the family she is going to comfort, give to the world? This totally schizophrenic situation parallels the West's denial regarding Saudi Arabia. <CN> One could say the same about White men slamming Islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding.

In many Muslim-majority countries, women are extraordinarily active and involved in education. As the land where Islam began, Saudi Arabia has enormous influence among Muslims worldwide. These values are precisely what sets the West apart from so many Muslim-majority countries which engage in religious apartheid and which persecute infidel religions.

Saudi Arabia's radical form of Islam mandates the death penalty for same-sex relations. The video was taken as a criticism of Saudi Arabia's law banning women from driving. <CN> Maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives.

Under the guardianship system, women in Saudi Arabia are prohibited from driving. This totally schizophrenic situation parallels the West's denial regarding Saudi Arabia. <CN> So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them.
